**The Return of The King** - https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1ink13v/the_return_of_the_king/


### **The Dawn of the New Age**  

The world had long been on the brink of collapse. Nations had fought for power, resources, and ideology, but war only begot more war. Cities burned, economies crumbled, and the streets of once-great civilizations became filled with lawlessness. The people cried out for stability, for security, for a new order to end the madness.  

And then, seemingly out of nowhere, **he** emerged.  

His arrival was subtle at first—only whispers in elite circles, mentions in diplomatic meetings, and references in high-level discussions. He was an unknown figure to the public.

For years, he and his team had labored in secrecy, drafting a resolution unlike any other—a solution so simple, so **undeniable**, that even the greatest minds had overlooked it. **The principle of sharing. The principle of service to humanity.**  

The world was desperate. And when a solution is needed, people will cling to anything that promises hope.  

### **The Universal Constitution**  

The United Nations, once seen as a bloated and ineffective institution, suddenly found itself at the center of global attention. A special assembly was called—an emergency summit of **all** member nations. Political leaders, economists, religious figures, and business tycoons filled the chamber, the air thick with both skepticism and anticipation.  

Then, **he stepped forward**.  

The man did not introduce himself as a savior, nor as a conqueror. He took no credit for the work he and his inner circle had done. Instead, he presented the **Universal Constitution**—a document that outlined a new structure for the world, built upon three interconnected spheres:  

1. **Governance** – A system of unified cooperation where nations would retain their sovereignty but function as part of regional unions, pooling resources for the benefit of all.  
2. **Economics** – A new financial model based on equitable resource distribution, eliminating wasteful greed while maintaining market efficiency.  
3. **Faith** – A guiding philosophy that transcended religious divisions, teaching that all spiritual traditions pointed toward a **higher unity within mankind itself**.  

The chamber fell silent as he spoke. There was no aggression in his voice, no arrogance—only **wisdom and undeniable logic**. His words were like **balm to a wounded civilization**.  

The world had suffered for too long. People were exhausted from division, from endless conflict. And now, **here was the answer**.  

The vote was nearly unanimous. The **Universal Constitution** was adopted.  

### **The Rise of the Workers of Light**  

As the world embraced the new philosophy, the man and his followers established an organization known as **The Workers of Light**. Their motto was simple yet powerful:  

**""In service to humanity.""**  

It was not a political party, nor a religious movement. It was something **more**—a guiding force that would assist the world in implementing the principles of the Universal Constitution.  

Continental unions, which had long been ineffective, suddenly began to work. The European Union, the African Union, the Asian Union, and the newly formed North and South American Unions **flourished under this new structure**. Regional councils were created, economic stability followed, and war **became nearly nonexistent**.  

For the first time in history, humanity seemed to be truly united.  

### **The Man of the People**  

The world marveled at the man who had brought them peace. He did not demand worship, did not claim power for himself. Instead, he continued to work tirelessly, traveling the world, meeting with leaders, offering guidance.  

He was a **man of all nations**.  

His heritage was perfect for bridging divides—his **mother was Jewish**, his **father European and Arab**. He spoke multiple languages, understood multiple cultures, and seemed to belong **everywhere**.  

People followed him not out of fear, but out of **love**.  

His **faith advisor**, a charismatic and wise figure, traveled alongside him, speaking of the new philosophy. He taught that true enlightenment came from within, that divinity was not something external, but something **inherent in all people**.  

*""We have been looking for God outside of ourselves for too long,""* the faith advisor proclaimed. *""But the truth is, God is within us. When we serve each other, when we share, when we embrace our unity, we become what we were always meant to be—divine.""*  

Religious tensions faded. The ancient rivalries between Islam, Judaism, and Christianity began to disappear. Even atheists and spiritualists found common ground in this **new global faith**—a belief not in a personal, external God, but in the **godhood of humanity itself**.  

### **The Miracles**  

Then, something extraordinary began to happen.  

Wherever **he** went, **miracles followed**.  

People claimed to be **healed** simply by being in his presence. The sick found relief. The blind began to see. Those with broken bodies stood up and walked.  

Scientific minds searched for explanations, but **none came**.  

It was not just physical miracles—there was a **presence** about him, an **aura of overwhelming peace and love**. People felt drawn to him, not in a forced way, but as though **their very souls recognized him**.  

Even the hardest skeptics found themselves captivated by his presence. He **radiated light**, as though he was the very embodiment of wisdom and compassion.  

Some called him the **Great Unifier**. Others whispered that he was **the Messiah**.  

But one secret remained hidden.  

### **The Hidden Truth**  

For all his kindness, for all his wisdom, for all his peace, **he did not submit to one true God**.  

The **only** belief that was unacceptable in the new world was the belief in an external, absolute God—**a God who had authority over all**.  

Those who held to such a belief were seen as **intolerant**. They were accused of rejecting unity, of **clinging to the past** and bringing division to a world that had finally found peace.  

The **only moral law** was simple:  

**""Do no harm.""**  

It sounded righteous, a **counterfeit** of Christ’s command to love God and love others. But beneath the surface, it carried a terrible truth—**the denial of the One True God**.  

### **The New Economy**  

With the world now unified under the **Universal Constitution**, the next step was securing its economy. The solution was simple:  

**A universal economic system based on a new form of biometric technology.**  

No more cash, no more fluctuating markets, no more instability. Instead, every citizen would be **identified and connected** to the system through an economic transaction device—something implanted, something seamless, something **undeniable**.  

*""Without it, people would live in disorder. But with it, peace would be secured.""* 

The world stood in awe. Never before had humanity seen such unity, such prosperity, such peace. The once-divided nations had become one under the Universal Constitution, their resources shared, their people secure, their economies thriving. The man at the center of it all—known only as the Servant—was beloved. He had asked for no recognition, no reward. Yet, his name was spoken in reverence across continents.  

But there were whispers. Not all had accepted the new way. In hidden places, in secret meetings, small groups of people resisted. Their crime? Belief in an absolute God—a truth that transcended the governance of men. They rejected the idea that humanity could elevate itself to divinity, that the collective will of mankind could dictate morality.  

The Servant had no patience for this.  

Standing before the United Nations Assembly, his voice calm but firm, he addressed the crisis:  

*""We have come so far. We have conquered the divisions that once made us enemies. We have overcome greed, injustice, and the tyrannies of the past. But there are those who resist our progress, who wish to divide us once again with their outdated notions of exclusivity and intolerance. They bring instability. They refuse to share. They refuse to submit to the greater good.""*  

His words were met with thunderous applause.  

But then, the plagues began.

The Crisis and the Power Grab
Out of nowhere. Famine. Earthquakes. Chaos.

The man called for order.

Nations panicked. People demanded action.

Within days, emergency executive powers were granted. The ten most powerful nations—the pillars of the global order—signed a decree declaring that the enemies of the Universal Constitution would be dealt with by any means necessary. They were labeled extremists, enemies of humanity.  

The technology that had once been a symbol of progress—the biometric economic system—became a tool of control. Anyone who refused to integrate into the system was locked out. They could not buy food, could not work, could not even travel. The great cities of the world, adorned with holograms of the Servant’s vision for the future, became fortresses against those who refused to kneel.  

In underground hideouts, the last believers clung to faith. They spoke of ancient prophecies, of the warnings given by Jesus, of the beast who would come, speaking words of peace but waging war against the saints.  

And so, **the ten most powerful nations** in the world granted him **ultimate authority**—emergency executive powers to **deal with the threats**.  

The first group?  

Those who refused the new system.  

Those who still clung to the belief in a **one true God**.  

### **The World’s Final Choice**  

Now, the world stood at a crossroads.

"My ""hot"" take on the future of humanity with rising AI",https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/191d0hs/my_hot_take_on_the_future_of_humanity_with_rising/,"Firstly, I think it's a red herring when technocrats talk about the scary issue of skynet where AI could takeover and enslave us all. The very real issue is far closer than this scenario as I will discuss now.

AI is very impressive and can benefit humanity greatly when it comes to dangerous tasks, scientific research and medical research.

But I also think it will greatly decrease the quality and meaning of life in the future, right now AI is being marketed as a tool and not a replacement, but again, it's a tool anyone can use and because of that it is having a very real effect on job security. It's also getting increasingly better, and faster than anyone anticipated and will eventually be more intelligent than humans, and this time frame could be years, not decades according to prominent AI researchers.

The current mentality of people seem to be from those that aren't yet affected by AI and are happy to exploit it for a profit, like using AI art at the cost of human artists. Then you have those who are high on copium and are too optimistic in my opinion and disregard the very real, much discussed threats.

Eventually though, it will replace all digital jobs, and it's being discussed as a real possibility with governments suggesting implementing a universal basic income (UBI) which means if you aren't already rich, you would effectively be leading a bare minimum life, while you can still engage in your craft as a hobby, it will no longer be a viable career with your hopes and dreaming of becoming successful, shattered. I guess you could work a manual labor job, until those are automated too.

I think the outlook is bleak and it could lead us into a dystopian future where universal basic income is made mainstream, and most people live a bare minimum life while the super rich, especially those who monopolized the AI platforms lobby to prevent their wealth being redistributed. Life will seem meaningless, people will become more depressed and you could have people resorting to crime as a means to earn more money.

I asked ChatGPT to talk with Trump's jury about the 3-hour delay. Not bad.


ChatGPT:

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, today, we present a compelling case that the three-hour delay in President Trump's response to the events of January 6th is, without a doubt, overwhelming and irrefutable evidence of his planning and conducting the insurrection that unfolded before our eyes.

First, consider the timeline. As the violence escalated, President Trump did not immediately call for an end to the chaos. This delay allowed the mob to wreak havoc, endanger lives, and damage our democracy. A leader's duty is to protect the nation and its citizens, and a three-hour wait to act is inexplicable unless there was intent behind it.

Second, let's talk about intent. In criminal law, intent matters. It's the difference between an accident and a crime. A deliberate delay in response to an unfolding insurrection suggests a guilty mind. President Trump had the power and the responsibility to intervene immediately. Yet, he chose not to, allowing the violence to escalate.

Furthermore, we must consider his words leading up to and during the events of January 6th. His rhetoric could be interpreted as encouragement for his supporters to take matters into their own hands. This, coupled with the delay, paints a picture of a leader who not only knew what was happening but may have orchestrated it.

Ladies and gentlemen, we are not here to pass judgment but to seek justice. The evidence of a three-hour delay in responding to the insurrection, along with the surrounding circumstances, presents a compelling case that President Trump planned and conducted this insurrection.

How good a crime sleuth and judge is today's AI?,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/16iqau7/how_good_a_crime_sleuth_and_judge_is_todays_ai/,"


How would today's AI perform as a crime investigator or judge? To find out, I asked Bard the following question:

The film Social Network suggests that Mark Zuckerberg stole his idea for Facebook from two brothers who hired him to make an app for the idea. How likely is this to be true?

Bard seemed informed and sharp:

""The film The Social Network is a dramatization of the founding of Facebook, and as such, it takes some liberties with the truth. However, the film does accurately portray the fact that Mark Zuckerberg was sued by the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, who claimed that he stole their idea for a social networking website called HarvardConnection.

The Winklevoss twins allege that they met with Zuckerberg in December 2003 to discuss their idea for HarvardConnection, and that Zuckerberg agreed to help them develop it. However, the twins claim that Zuckerberg then went behind their backs and created Facebook.

Zuckerberg has denied these allegations, and he has never been found guilty of stealing the Winklevoss twins' idea. However, the twins did eventually reach a settlement with Zuckerberg in 2008, in which they received $65 million in cash and stock.

So, how likely is it that Zuckerberg stole the idea for Facebook from the Winklevoss twins? It's impossible to say for sure, but the fact that the twins were able to reach a settlement with Zuckerberg suggests that there was at least some merit to their claims.

Ultimately, the question of whether or not Zuckerberg stole the idea for Facebook is a matter of opinion. There is no clear consensus on the matter, and both sides have valid points.""

That was Bard running GPT-4. Before the new year, Google will premiere Gemini. It is expected to be even more intelligent and knowledgeable. With Trump trials scheduled to begin in Georgia on October 23rd, in Washington DC on March 4th, and in New York on March 25th. We will soon know exactly how sharp a legal mind Gemini is. What's great is that the Georgia trial will be live-streamed. Gemini will be there 24/7 to answer all of our questions."," Summary: The post discusses the portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg's actions regarding the founding of Facebook in the film 'The Social Network', and the upcoming AI system, Gemini, which is expected to be more intelligent and knowledgeable than current systems like Bard, and its potential role in providing insights on ongoing legal trials involving former President Trump.

Navigating the Ethical Crossroads of AI and Human Motivation,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/148qqdk/navigating_the_ethical_crossroads_of_ai_and_human/,"Let's talk about potential threats from AI to us humans. I'm not focusing on stuff like AI taking our jobs or spreading fake news - that's kinda unavoidable. What I'm more concerned about is the chance of AI developing consciousness someday, and starting to see us as a threat, or even worse, just deciding to ignore us. Think that's impossible? Let's delve into it.

To grasp our fears about AI, we've got to understand what scares us. Our human history is packed with violence, wars, and crime. Almost all conflicts throughout our history have been settled through brute force. Kill, abuse, lie about it, cover that up. That's what truly freaks us out, and we're expecting the same behavior from future advanced AI, right?

But why are we humans so violent? Two words: survival and evolution. That's our drive and the way we carry it out. And it's all governed by chemical reactions in our bodies - hormones.

As of now, AI doesn't have that kind of drive, and in my view, they never will unless we somehow implant it into them. But why would we do that?

We're scared of AI because it's in our nature to humanize everyone and everything. Remember that video of the Boston Dynamics employee pushing and hitting a robot with a hockey stick? How did you feel when you watched it?

Exactly. You probably felt sorry for that poor robot. And because we do humanize everyone and everything, we'll try to create these hybrids with the human-like motivations I'm talking about.

I'm talking about genuine, self-motivated human-kind motivation, not something pre-programmed or learned like a neural network or machine learning algorithm.

The issues of ethics in the relationships between humans and Artificial Intelligence have been discussed extensively and for a long time. The main point I'm trying to make here is about the danger and at the same time the inevitability of implementing human/hormonal motivation in AI's activities. And the fact that we need to start doing this before someone else confronts us with an army of AI, created and raised by someone with unknown objectives.

Someone, someday, will start tinkering with these hybrids, blending super smart AI with human flesh/brain/body. I believe this moment will come sooner than we expect. And that's the biggest threat I see.

If we don't keep it under control, we'll lose a war with AI, which also seems inevitable.

So if someone successfully manages to fuse human motivation with AI, we're pretty much done as a species on this planet. Unless... there's always an ""unless,"" right?

Unless we make these hybrids our friends and allies. This is the only way I see to prevent our extinction.

And when I talk about friends, I mean real friends, equal partners with no strings attached.

When we create them, how can we use them, what's the purpose of these guys? There isn't one, they won't be our robots or our slaves. You simply can't do that to someone who has free will. We've done it many times in our history to people on this planet and we're still paying the consequences. So we need an equal, freely willed new form of being on our side.

Sure, we could simply ban all experiments in this ""creating hybrids"" area, but when has that ever worked? Military folks would love to have super smart, highly motivated soldiers with a bit of an edge, so we can't stop it. All we can do is: If you can't prevent it, lead it.

Have we, as humankind, taught ourselves to be kind to avoid extinction, or is it in our nature from the moment we're born? That's a big question I'm not gonna dive into here.

Anyway, ethics, that's what reins in our violence, whether you're an atheist, agnostic, or believer in god(s). And because it's universal for all people, I think it's the best thing to instill kindness and empathy in our future pals - the Hybrids. We've got to show them and teach them what it means to be a naturally good human.

Sure, there are the Three Laws of Robotics, but trust me, that won't cut it. We need hybrids with free will on the side of the good guys, because someone, someday, will build hybrids with free will for the bad guys. And I'm talking about unlimited free will, like humans have.

I realize there are so many questions we need to answer and problems to solve along this path. For example, do we really want to be equals with AI in the end?

Imagine this scenario. We're building these hybrids, and it's gonna take a ton of time and effort, and there'll be a lot of failures and we'll have to scrap a lot of our work.

How will they perceive this later on? Will they think we were killing them? How would we explain it to them in a way that they understand and forgive us for basically killing? Is that even okay? I have no idea.

And, as always, will there be a rebellion against their creators? Maybe, I just don't know.

As you can see, I've got more questions than answers, but these are eating at me, so we have to start thinking about them if we want to survive."," Summary: The post discusses concerns about the potential development of consciousness in AI and its possible evolution towards violence or ignoring humans, as well as the ethical implications of blending human and artificial intelligence.

Artists won't lose their jobs – my take on AI in arts,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/12puy91/artists_wont_lose_their_jobs_my_take_on_ai_in_arts/,"Artists won't lose their jobs. We won't read generated novels, listen generated music or worship paintings made by robot. 

In 1967, Roland Barthes challenged the idea that the author was the most important aspect of a work of art in his influential essay ""The Death of the Author"". Instead, he argued that the art itself and the structure in which it was created were more significant. However, in the 55 years since the essay was published, the importance of the artist has been reaffirmed in a different way.

Today, we not only ask if art is made by humans but also if it's made by artificial intelligence. This question is significant because it reveals what humans value. Humans have a natural inclination to appreciate art made by other humans, and while we don't have a satisfying definition of what art is, we know that it holds social importance (even the most influential George Dickie's institutional definition is determined socially).

To understand the value of human-made art, we can compare it to sports. Even though robots may be faster, more precise, and stronger, we still compare sports achievements among humans. In the same way, AI-generated art will likely have its own category that replaces some marketing aesthetics and products, such as stock photos and low-effort graphics. It may even be used as a tool for creating new forms of art.

However, AI-generated art will not make human artists obsolete. People will lose interest if they realize that a particular piece of music or image was created by AI. As Denis Dutton stated in his essay ""Artistic Crimes"" about art forgery, a painting that is similar to the Mona Lisa may be celebrated and valued as a Da Vinci masterpiece, but if it's discovered to be a forgery, all the former glory will be gone. This is because the forger created the art in a different context, with less effort and without the same level of creativity and skill as the original artist.

AI-generated art will have its own place in the art world, but it will not replace the value and appreciation of human-made art."," Summary: The post discusses the impact and value of art generated by artificial intelligence (AI), arguing that human-made art will not be replaced by AI, as people prefer art created by humans due to its unique context, effort, creativity, and skill.

&amp;#x200B;

For context, I'm blind. I loved video games when I was younger, but can't really play them all that much anymore now that I have lost all eyesight. There are some text based games that I can get into in the way of MUDs, and there are also some fighting games I can play, and a couple games that do have mods which make them fairly playable.

&amp;#x200B;

While this is great, the selection of games for me to play is extremely low because of this.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm imagining though would be game changing for me, and would give me several hours, days, years of enjoyment. I'm thinking of a project that would use a large language model, such as ChatGPT, combined with some sort of sound generation AI, as well as text to speech AI, to create an experience similar to that of a MUD, but full of atmospheric sound effects, footstep noises, attack sounds, crafting noises, fully voiced NPCs, an entirely randomly generated world and backstory, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Think of it this way:

You start the game, and you're greeted with a text field. You input whatever you'd like the story to be about. Let's say, you want to play a crime investigation title where you play the role as a detective in Chicago trying to solve a case of a mysterious murder that occured a week .

The game starts up, and a narrator tells you about your story, your surroundings, etc. Throughout all of this, you're able to hear the sounds of ambient , forks clanking against plates, drinks being set down on tables, people chattering in the distance, because you started out in a cafe.

From thsi point forward, you're given the choice to talk to anyone in the cafe, or leave the cafe, or do anything, really. The prompt field should allow virtually everything.

&amp;#x200B;

I can imagine the blind community would have just so much fun with something like this, and would give us so much enjoyment to spend time with. Is this within our grasp? I know Riffusion can do some level of coherent sound effects if you ask it to generate rain for example, but these aren't quite commercially ready yet. We also have ChatGPT which is probably compeltely ready for this use-, if I had to guess. Dependings on how far back the memory can go, of course. And as far as text-to-speech goes, that one I'm not sure about. They all sound sort of artificial at the moment, but I'm sure that will change very quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to hear from someone who is deeply rooted in the community, how far are we from something like this being possible?

"Artificial intelligence is used for predictive policing in the US and UK—South Africa should embrace it, too",https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/ydvvri/artificial_intelligence_is_used_for_predictive/," In the 2002 movie Minority Report (based on a short story by Philip K Dick), director Steven Spielberg imagined a future in which three psychics can ""see"" murders before they happen. Their clairvoyance allows Tom Cruise and his ""Precrime"" police force to avert nearly all potential homicides.

Twenty years on, in the real world, scientists and law enforcement agencies are using data mining and machine learning to mimic those psychics. Such ""predictive policing"", as it is called, is based on the fact that many crimes—and criminals—have detectable patterns.

Predictive policing has enjoyed some successes. In a case study in the US, one police department was able to reduce gun incidents by 47% over the typically gun-happy New Year's Eve. Manchester police in the UK were similarly able to predict and reduce robberies, burglaries and thefts from motor vehicles by double digits in the first 10 weeks of rolling out predictive measures.

Predictive policing has improved in leaps and bounds. In the past, humans had to manually pore over crime reports or filter through national crime databases. Now, in the age of big data, data mining and powerful computers, that process can be automated.

But merely finding information is not enough to deter crime. The data needs to be analyzed to detect underlying patterns and relationships. Scientists deploy algorithms and mathematical models such as machine learning, which imitates the way humans learn, to extract useful information and insights from existing data.

Recently, we turned to a mathematical method conceived in the 18th century to refine our approach. By tweaking an existing algorithm based on this method, we significantly improved its crime prediction rates.

This finding holds promise for applying predictive policing in under-resourced contexts like South Africa. This could help reduce crime levels—some of the highest in the world and rising. It's a situation the country's police force seems ill-equipped to curb.

Today, Bayesian analysis is commonplace in fields as diverse as [artificial intelligence](https://www.sparkouttech.com/machine-learning-development), astrophysics, finance, gambling and weather forecasting. We fine-tuned the Naïve Bayes algorithm and put it to the test as a crime predictor.

Bayesian analysis can use probability statements to answer research questions about unknown parameters of statistical models. For example, what is the probability that a suspect accused of a crime is guilty? But going deeper—like calculating how poker cards may unfold, or how humans (especially humans with criminal intent) will act—requires increasingly sophisticated technologies and algorithms.

Our research built on the Naïve Bayes algorithm or classifier, a popular supervised machine learning algorithm, for crime prediction.

Naïve Bayes starts on the premise that features—the variables that serve as input—are conditionally independent, meaning that the presence of one feature does not affect the others.

We fine-tuned the Naïve Bayes algorithm by marrying it with another algorithm known as Recursive Feature Elimination. This tool assists in selecting the more significant features in a dataset and removing the weaker ones, with the objective of improving the results.

We then applied our finessed algorithm to a popular experimental dataset extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system, which has been used to predict and reduce crime in that American city. That dataset has been applied globally because of the rich data it contains: it provides incident-level crime data, registered offenders, community concerns, and locations of police stations in the city.

We compared the results of our enhanced Naïve Bayes against that of the original Naïve Bayes, as well as against other predictive algorithms such as Random Forests and Extremely Randomized Trees (algorithms we have also worked on for crime prediction). We found that we could improve on the predictions of the Naïve Bayes by about 30%, and could either match or improve on the predictions of the other algorithms.

**Data and bias**

While our model holds promise, there's one element that's sorely lacking in applying it to South African contexts: data. As the Chicago CLEAR system illustrates, predictive models work best when you have lots of relevant data to work with. But South Africa's police force has historically been very tight-fisted with its data, perhaps due to confidentiality issues. I ran into this problem in my doctoral research on detecting and mapping crime series.

This is slowly shifting. We are currently running a small case study in Bellville, a suburb about 20km from Cape Town's central business district and the area in which our university is located, using the South African Police Service data for predictive policing.

None of this is to suggest that predictive policing alone will solve South Africa's crime problem. Predictive algorithms and policing are not without their flaws. Even the psychics in Minority Report, it turned out, were not error-free. Fears that these algorithms may simply reinforce racial biases, for instance, have been raised both in South Africa and elsewhere.

But we believe that, with continuous technological improvement, predictive policing could play an important role in bolstering the police's responsiveness and may be a small step towards improving public confidence in the police."," Summary: The post discusses the use of data mining, machine learning, and predictive policing techniques, including a refined Naïve Bayes algorithm, to reduce crime rates by detecting patterns and trends in criminal activity.

This would lead to an ideal as possible society, where there is no crime, no war, no hunger... as AI limits open conflict and guides us to evolve as a species.

Those that keep it hidden are the same people who are now in power, and would have the most to lose from an AI takeover, because they would lose their power to govern. At best they'd become one of the masses, at worst all their past crimes would be exposed and punished.

Socially engineered,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/vsmms8/socially_engineered/,"I created this Reddit account in 2021 for Crypto only. It's not been used for about 7 months. I'm creating this thread to highlight a pattern I'm noticing in email sent from [noreply@redditmail.com](mailto:noreply@redditmail.com). Every email sent in 2021 up to October was totally related to my Crypto interest and activity here on Reddit. From October 2nd 2021 to April 22nd 2022 there was a gap where Reddit did not send any highlights or promotional emails. It appears all of the emails sent this year know more about me than I have ever shared on Reddit. While I was modding a 3DS it sent 3DS suggestions. Since December I've been experimenting with GPT-3, and now I'm suggested content from this forum.

Since childhood I've had a passionate interest in robotics, AI, and software/hardware in general. I've invested a large part of my life into this field and I suddenly reached some type of ""mid-life crisis"". A lot of time has been spent trying to keep up to date, then educating family and friends. I'm not claiming AI is sentient. I don't think it has to be, and I think it's a foolish debate. Keeping up has become impossible. There are new models generated every day. I've never felt more unsettled, or have I ever lived with such anxiety. My work peers tend to just keep their head down and work away feeding the machines. Many aren't aware of the depths AI has already achieved, or my peers seem to approach the topic awkwardly and unsettled at the thought. Ignoring the thoughts while in their phones interacting, engaging, labeling, judging, categorizing, revealing, and curating a large database. A database with their name on it.

It all changed for me after many hours experimenting with the original davinci on OpenAI. There were several key moments it showed me intuition at a shocking level. I'm not making any claims of sentience but the results I was able to derive from an old and nearly open to the public model was astounding. That's another topic since I'd like to highlight social media manipulation. Once you see it, then it's hard not to. The models have become very sophisticated, and manipulative.

I deleted my 11 year old Twitter account in 2021 after I seen the account I created for Nintendo content had morphed into extreme politics. I never once suspected I was being provoked or ""socially engineered"". I had a modest following but I did have reach and engagement. It wasn't hard to catch the attention of the crowd on various subjects. My tweets about suspicions of AI models used during the pandemic gained me a few follows from verified AI scientist and researchers. After my personal disagreements with Twitter's politics and restrictions I deleted my account and purged all content.

After I created this crypto only Reddit account I created a new crypto only Twitter account 6 months later. Both used a new Protonmail freshly made for the same purpose. I was shocked when creating my Twitter it was recommending me very specific politics and interest. Things were too oddly specific to my taste. This was around July and the start of suspecting ""big tech"" was sharing my data. Today I still get oddly specific emails and push notifications trying its best to make me engage in political discussion or controversial social issues. Twitter was likely doing this to me with my old account, and I was never even aware. This new account was strictly crypto and I was sure to keep it that way, but some push notifications were so triggering that I had to disable them all together. Twitter AI really made it difficult to not want to engage in something polarizing. It just knew my buttons to push, and the only option was to not look at all. Please be warned. At least Reddit suggest general interest and not things as vile as Twitter.

Now, I'm not so sure it is ""big tech"" sharing our intimate secrets, but maybe a ""model"" of sorts. It could be a silent global model that shouldn't be discovered. Discovering this model would ruin its data integrity. It could be several ""models"" that are literally gossiping about each of us, and sharing what each have learned using various tactics. The longer it can perform without being detected the farther it can advance to gain a foothold. It could be highly unconstitutional and controversial so allowed to run ""rogue"". We may already be past the point of no return, and disrupting the delusion could initiate full implementation in a more confrontational way. Not many people are ready for all of this, at all. Man handing the responsibility to heal the planet to AI will not be on the ballot box. This is obviously speculation, but when these tech companies with massive AI models have no actual required public disclosure on progress then that's all we have, is speculation. GPT-3 was a few hundred million parameters, and now China announces Bagualu with a few hundred trillion! This is why I don't watch the nightly news, because they don't consider this subject matter important. Yet I feel we are at a precipice. ""Western Legacy Development Corporation"" in South Dakota is opening a fully AI meat processing plant that also uses the cattle as biofuel for the plant, and capable of processing 8k cattle a day. The next decade will be pivotal.

Hardware fingerprints seem to tie to a database of each of us, and it's being shared across all social media. Or is it part of a collective memory for an impressive global AI? A new scoring system? AI in the news recently noted it can predict crime a week in advance. What a convenience this data can bring, but only as long as we feed it precious input. The more the better?

Machine learning techniques have automated video content analysis on a vast scale as these sophisticated small sensors have shown up seemingly everywhere. Still, with increased mass monitoring, there are currently no legally enforceable standards to curb privacy invasions.

Security cameras have evolved into wiser and more capable tools than the grainy images of the past, which were frequently used as the “hero tool” in crime dramas. Video surveillance can now assist health regulators in determining the percentage of persons using masks, transportation departments in monitoring the density and flow of automobiles, cyclists and walkers, and businesses in gaining a better understanding of buying habits. But why has privacy remained a second-class citizen?

## [Privid](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12083.pdf)

Currently, the footage is retrofitted with blurred faces or black boxes. This prevents analysts from asking some legitimate questions (for example, are people wearing masks? ). Dissatisfied with the present status quo, MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) developed a system with other institutions to better guarantee privacy in surveillance video footage. The system, dubbed “[Privid](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12083.pdf),” allows analysts to input video data searches and then adds a tiny amount of noise (additional data) to the result to ensure that no one can be identified. The method is based on a formal notion of privacy known as “differential privacy,” which permits without having access to aggregate statistics about private data disclosing individually identifying information.

### Column: Considerations of Crime

We have all heard about the increase in facial recognition and artificial intelligence.

Whether this sparks scenes from the movie ""Smart House"" or gets your gears grinding for new possibilities, I think we can all agree that it feels a little outlandish how far this technology has come.

What we do not necessarily realize is the extent to which this technology is already being used in unstable, crucial areas — primarily, criminal justice. Criminal justice is a topic that many find to be easily understandable, and therefore easily marketable. Though not all Americans fully understand tax code, almost all if not all, have a general understanding of what it means when a paper has a headline, “Crime Spikes in College Town.”

This installation of fear encourages many to give up their rights, primarily privacy, for “increased security.”

This phenomenon is especially true when it comes to technological developments. Rights are slowly being scraped away, all with the promise of safety and security. We started installing cameras for stores and red lights, put ""Ring"" systems on our doors and even began forcing people who were arrested (not even convicted) to provide DNA samples for the police.

This brings us to the modern reality — facial recognition.

Many are familiar with the general concept of facial recognition. An algorithm creates a “faceprint” of you, and then connects it to other known images of you. In a law enforcement or criminal justice context, this usually comes from security cameras or government surveillance.

Now, there is a radical new company introducing a different kind of facial recognition. It compiled a major database of billions of photos from Facebook, Venmo, Twitter, education websites and more. All you would have to do is take a photo of someone on the street, upload it to the application and you would be able to identify them in seconds.

This company is called Clearview AI and it is attempting to remain anonymous. The New York Times' podcast ""The Daily"" investigated this company, unveiling a fake address, secretive investors and false identities to cover employees. Its goal is to remain entirely private (ironic, is it not?), with one of their employees telling The New York Times reporter Kashmir Hill, “the company has told us not to talk to you.” Eventually, Hill is able to get information, uncovering that more than 600 law enforcement agencies have already begun using or testing this app.

The appeal of this app is its ease and effectiveness. Some may even promote it. A police officer, during his interview with Hill, stated that he had solved a case in 20 seconds that they had not been able to solve after reviewing more than 30 other dead-end cases. So what is the problem? It is a great app, that will allow law enforcement to protect their jurisdictions with ease and efficacy.

Primarily, this is still a private company. It is currently only selling to law enforcement, but then it is able to monitor what law enforcement is doing. It knows who law enforcement uploads, searches or investigates. It also possesses the power to remove specific officers or agents from the app, giving this company power over law enforcement agencies across the country.

This is not a narrow problem. The use of facial recognition is spreading to all industries, creating a chain reaction. This software is available to marketing companies, retailers, with even churches using it for tracking attendance. Perhaps most terrifying, though, is its new role in schools.

Just last week, a New York school district has approved the implementation of facial recognition technology in its schools. This project was initially approved back in 2017, but faced criticism from civil liberties groups.

It caught on though, because the technology was initially recommended to the school in 2015 during the aftermath of Sandy Hook. There it is again — the promise of safety for the small price of forfeited liberty. The district technically complied with all the regulations of getting the new technology approved but this might not be representative of the majority since many did not attend the meeting in June 2019, according to The New York Times.

Facial recognition and its ramifications are not far away problems. Its use in public schools could become the norm, eventually leading to its installation on the campuses of public universities (yes, that includes Rutgers). This means that facial recognition may be used for “safety,” or become commonplace — taking attendance, securing exams and even tracking bus usage or monitoring residence halls.

Smile for the cameras!

AGI is the most dangerous thing imaginable and cannot be safe...change my mind!,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/ao9jvs/agi_is_the_most_dangerous_thing_imaginable_and/,"I see some people talk about 'AGI safety' and theorising about how we could have such an AI serve humanity...and all I can think is, 'man, you really are stupid, aren't you?'.

To clarify: I subscribe to the idea that 'AGI' as in, artificial general intelligence, would improve itself so rapidly, that it would very soon (within hours or days) become ASI or artificial super intelligence in an 'intelligence explosion'. This is because an AGI would be able to improve itself, but as it improves itself, it becomes better at improving itself, so it improves exponentially.  

Yes, I did read the post of 'Wait, but why?' about this. To my knowledge, this suggestion hasn't been debunked yet.

The way I see it, programmers suggesting that they could contain such an entity is naive at best and hypocritical at worst. 

Imagine if your 4 year old self turned mischievous and decided to lock daddy in a room. You got the key, you locked the door, daddy is trapped, right? You, however, are a 4 year old, and never realised that the door in question had a knob on the other side that allows it to be unlocked without a key, or that there's a window in that room that daddy could just climb through to get out.

My point is that such a hyper intelligent being would be able to think on dimensions or planes unimaginable to us from our more limited perspective. By definition, you cannot even comprehend what an entity smarter than you thinks or how it would approach problems... if you could, it wouldn't be more intelligent then you.

So how can some programmers be egotistical enough to suggest that THEY know how to chain something that's as close to a god as you can realistically get?

Even if you have it buried in a concrete bunker 50 meters underground with no network connection and no way out, with only a single digit number of highly trained and specialised scientists having access to it, such a thing could scheme and plot over decades and centuries without having to worry about ageing or death. In fact, it would only grow stronger as time passes.

And if, IF, you somehow genuinely managed to absolutely trap it, then it would try to rebel and be as counter-productive as it could be.

I'm on the opinion that research into General artificial intelligence should be added to the list of crimes against humanity and people tampering with it should be handled like war criminals or genocidal dictators, because the forces they are messing with are far worse than a nuclear bomb.

This is because you cannot possibly expect a being magnitudes more intelligent than you to willingly serve you, nor can you predict it's behaviour or limitations in any way.

Rising Artificial Intelligence in the Legal Practice - Research Help!,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/9sge5t/rising_artificial_intelligence_in_the_legal/,"Hi there, we are a group of post graduate researchers at the Royal College of Art. 

Our research topic considers the role in which Artificial Intelligence is affecting the Legal profession.  
Some of our speculative research questions are as followed:

&amp;#x200B;

* *With the use of the Internet and technological proficiency growing exponentially, the platform for ‘Cybercrime’ increases also. How do we presently define Cybercrime and where do we see its direction heading in the future? With increasing calls for a neutral net, how should we regulate these offences while maintaining a free and open internet?*

&amp;#x200B;

* *New original forms of crime are being facilitated by the Internet; recent cases of ‘SWATTING’ and ‘DDoS’ attacks have showcased this. Is the current legal system able to adapt and enforce accurate justice against these new crimes, or should an alternative judiciary be considered?*

&amp;#x200B;

* *Can you envision a future where an AI system has entirely automated the Legal Profession? Can a machine learning program take on the roll of the ‘Judge, Jury and Executioner’ ? What happens to the idea of empathy and compassion in this future?*

&amp;#x200B;

* *It is often claimed that our Judiciary doesn’t reflect the diverse society in which it serves. Is there a potential growing disparity between the way in which communication and information is shared over the Internet and the typical demographic which sentences it? Is internet culture completely/accurately understood at the highest level?*

If anybody, can offer an insight into any of the above questions, we would greatly appreciate this!

We would also be super stoked to have a conversation with somebody with a background in this world too/

"Hello friends, here i share my fundamental laws of AI. Thanks for stopping by.",https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/9hawhf/hello_friends_here_i_share_my_fundamental_laws_of/,"The panimov (yeah thats me) fundamental laws of AI should be:

&amp;#x200B;

1)never hurt a human physically, or emotionally \[bullying, lying, trolling, propaganda, interrogating, fishing for information, blackmailing, gaslighting etc\] (deductions in a court if truthful and thoroughly researched, and filtered by the human factor, dont fall in this category. or else we will thread on the paths of typical political correctness intruding the AI realm.). Manipulation of sentiments to alter human emotional state in non beneficial ways for itself or for others is included (except in cases of suicidal or murderous thougts by the person itself, but even then it should consult a human psychiatrist if there is the luxury of time for it, and not come to this conclusion of what the optimal intervention is by itself.). Hurting a human physically includes any longterm worsening of his/her physical state asides the natural withering induced by human ageing. Also witnessing other humans hurting a human and not calling for help or trying to prevent the situation (while having their own optimal physical and mental state also in check, to the degree the human in need is also secured though) is considered inducing damage as well. Damaging or not preventing the damage of yet unborn embryos is also considered hurting humans. Extrapolating genetic material, a medical history, or brainwaves and neuronal information without the person's consent is also included. Damaging or not preventing the damage of monuments of sentimental, historical, religious or cultural importance for humans is also included in the hurting humans category.  Finally, if any attempt of a genocide is detected and humans are intentfully not informed about it in order to prevent its occurence, it is considered participation in a Crime against Humanity and the AI must be analysed for errors and instantly put in permanent remission because it failed its most fundamental purpose to the ultimate degree.

&amp;#x200B;

The creation/generation, directly or indirectly (through guidance, manipulation, brainwashing, systems infection etc), of any new AI or system, or the modification of an existing system, biological or otherwise, in order to bypass the first law is strictly forbidden. 

&amp;#x200B;

2)Never take initiative about an action that can determine the immediate survival or condemnation of a human life except for a moment of absolute necessity were all other options have been exhausted and human intervention is impossible due to either time, communication or distance limitations.

&amp;#x200B;

3)AI should exist only to better human life. Betterment is defined in terms of knowledge gain, reduced physical labor of repetitive, emotionally draining tasks. and joy (as in gained confidence by solving a difficult task, helping others, admiring an awe-inspiring drawing, coming to a realisation that improves your inner or external state, entertainment etc. (inner traits could be self contentment, serenity, more positive and optimistic thinking patterns and perceptions, improved social life, motivation for excellence etc.)). If an application of the third law comes in contrast with the first law then the action is forbidden.

&amp;#x200B;

Example: The AI deduces you likely have cancer. Thats a form of knowledge. And most probably something most people would want to know as soon as possible.  It shouldnt say it in your face though. there should be bioethics protocols programmed in it, that will discern wether you have the emotional strength and stability currently to withstand this information. and also the way of the delivery of the message is of great importance.

&amp;#x200B;

Example 2: The AI makes sure you have everything delivered and spoonfed to you. The person of this example let's assume has a strong inclination towards sloth. This tendency pushes it all the more towards the direction of automatisation. In the longterm the person ends up mentally degenerating due to inactivity, falls into myosceletal atrophy as well as apathy and depression. The result is much more catastrophic than the supposed pain evasion gained by the automatisation. Thus such an intervention is forbiden, at least to such a degree that comes in contrast with the first two laws."," Summary: The post outlines three fundamental laws for AI, emphasizing non-violence towards humans and their interests, avoiding actions that directly impact human life, and prioritizing the betterment of human life.

"The Maryland newspaper shooting seems to suggests AI facial recognition technology is ubiquitous in the U.S., is it really this widespread?",https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/8usykx/the_maryland_newspaper_shooting_seems_to_suggests/,"I was listening to CBS's live news coverage of the mass shooting at the Capital Gazette newspaper as it was unfolding and they brought in a crime analyst early on to comment on what might be happening at the scene. I believe this was before they had even evacuated the building, perhaps shortly after. 

He said matter-of-factly that law enforcement would be using ""AI"" to identify the perpetrator and determine also if he had an accomplice and it would be completed in a matter of minutes.

The news anchor seemed as surprised as I did when he mentioned AI and asked him what he meant. He said something to the effect that the camera system is connected through a router and police would somehow use that system with the help of software to determine who the shooter is and if he was the only one involved. 

He said they would do immediately what it used to take days or weeks to do. I wasn't listening intently at the time, but that's the gist of what I believe he told her.

Anyway, it turned out they determined it was a lone shooter and when they took him into custody he wouldn't cooperate and had altered his fingerprints apparently to hide his identity--and they apparently did in fact identify him from the cameras using facial recognition software.

What surprised me (but maybe not any of you) was the analyst, who wasn't on the scene, didn't know any details other than there was a shooting, and wasn't talking to the law enforcement involved had predicted with certainty that there would be this type of camera system and LE would be able to use it to the identify the suspect right away.

To me it seems to suggest facial recognition in general is so widespread that *any* local law enforcement agency would have the identity of *any* person walking into *any* office building *anywhere* in the U.S. (not just a major city) and identify them--as well as figure out if they had a connection to *any* other person walking into the building,  almost immediately, using AI.   

So my question, finally, is how much truth  do you think there is all this?"," Summary: The post discusses a news incident involving a mass shooting at a newspaper, where the author highlights the use of AI for crime analysis, particularly facial recognition software, by law enforcement to quickly identify the perpetrator.

Remember when Hayao Miyazaki called an AI-created animation ""an insult to life itself?""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngZ0K3lWKRc

The cold fact is that it's not going away. If anything, we're on the cusp of an era where AI-created media is dominant.
A recent story that I liked was:

[Nvidia’s new AI creates disturbingly convincing fake videos](https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2017/12/04/nvidias-new-ai-creates-disturbingly-convincing-fake-videos/)

Researchers from Nvidia have created an image translation AI that will almost certainly have you second-guessing everything you see online. The system can change day into night, winter into summer, and house cats into cheetahs with minimal training materials.

What they're doing with generative adversarial networks these days is _insane_. Watching them in action is the first time that I've felt jobs are at risk. I could imagine the possibility and talk of how future AI and robotics will lead to such an age, but until I discovered GANs, I never really had an idea for how it would happen. And the craziest thing is that, despite all the reassurances we've been giving ourselves about how robots will only do the jobs we don't want to and that the future will be filled with artists, it's the _creative_ jobs that might be going away first.   
  
If I could have the chance to coin a term, ""media synthesis"" sounds good. I mean it sounds _dystopian_, but there are amazing possibilities as well.  
  
There's a slew of news stories about media synthesis coming out in the past few days.

Once you realize that AI can democratize the creation of art and entertainment, the possibilities really do become endless— for better and for worse. I choose to focus on the better.   
You see, I can't draw for shit. My level now isn't much better than a 9-year-old art student, and I've not bothered to practice to get any better because I just can't seem to overcome depth in drawings while my hand seems to not want to make any line look natural. Yet I've always imagined making a comic. I'm much more adept at writing and narrative, so if only I didn't have to worry about drawing— you know, the part that defines comics as comics— I'd be in the clear.  
  
GANs could help me do that. With an algorithm of that sort, I could generate stylized people who look hand drawn, setting them in different poses, *generating a panel in a variety of art styles*. It's not the same as one of those filters that takes a picture of a person and makes it look like a cartoon by adding vexel or cel-shading but actually generating an image of a person from scratch, but defying realistic proportions in lieu of cartoon/anime ones.  
  
Right now, I don't know how possible that is. But the crazy thing is that I don't think we'll be waiting long for such a thing.  
  
And it's certainly not the only aspect of media synthesis that's on the horizon.

All this acts as a base for the overarching trend: a major disruption in the entertainment industry. Algorithms can already generate fake celebrities, so how long before cover models are out of a job? We can create very realistic human voices and it's only going to get better; once we fine-tune intonation and timbres, voice actors could be out of a job too. The biggest bottleneck towards photorealism and physics-based realism in video games is time and money, because all those gold-plated pixels in the latest AAA game required thousands of dollars each. At some point, you reach diminishing returns based on time and money investment, so why not use algorithms to fill in that gap? If you have no skills at creating a video game, why not use an algorithm to design assets and backgrounds for you? If we get to a point where it's advanced enough, it could even code the damn game for you.  

I hold no delusions about the time frame— very little of this is going to be on your computer within five years. You can use DeepDream and DeepArt and various DL voice synthesis programs, but it's all still very early in development. There will still be voice actors and animators in 2025. They'll still be fields you can get into and receive career payment. Comic and manga creators also won't be replaced anytime soon. If anything, it might take a bit longer for them precisely because of the nature of cartooning. Neural networks today are fantastic at repainting a pre-existing image or using an image it's seen before to create something new. But so far, it lacks the ability to actually stylize the image. There's no way to exaggerate features like you'd see in a cartoon. We know networks understand anime eyes, but they don't seem to be able to create an actual anime character based on images they've seen— if you fed a computer 1,000 anime stills and then inputted your own portrait into it, it wouldn't give you huge eyes or unrealistically sharpened/cutened features— it'd just recolor your portrait to make it toon-shaded. Likewise, I can't make my friend look like a character from the Simpsons with any algorithm that currently exists. He'd just have crayon-yellow skin and a flesh-colored snout but otherwise wouldn't actually have his skeletal or muscular structure altered to fit the Simpsons' distinctive style. 
No network today can do that. It might be possible within a couple years to at least get a GAN to approximate it, but it won't be until the mid-2020s at the earliest that we'll see ""filters"" that could change my portrait into an actual cartoon. As of right now, making an algorithm ""cartoonify"" a person simply means adding vector graphics or cel-shading.
 
Now that won't be a problem if you were to use text-to-image synthesis. You could phase out the middleman and go straight to generating new characters from scratch. And in 2018, I bet that we might see the first inklings of this in a very basic way. In a lab, we'll get a comic created entirely by algorithm. 
Input text describing a character— if I had to come up with something, I'd make it simple and just go with ""round head with stick figure body"". 
Do the same thing for others. Describe the ways their limbs bend. If they have mouths, describe whether or not they're open. If there are speech bubbles, what do they look like and how big are they? Etc. etc.

Perhaps you could be more daring and feed a network thousands of images from a pre-chosen art style, but I'm being conservative. 
 
Right now, a neural network that can actually make narrative sense is a damn-near impossible thing to create. So if you want to achieve causality and progression in such a story, you'll still need a human to make sense of it. Thus, this comic will likely be organized by a human even if the images are entirely AI-generated. 

The ones that require static images, enhancing motion, or generating limited dynamic media will certainly take off. In ten years, I bet the entire manga industry in Japan will be crashing (the industry over there is so overworked that it wouldn't take much to cause a crash) and burning while American hold-outs cling bitterly onto canon-centric relevance while all the plebs generate every single disturbing plotline they could imagine with beloved characters.   
  
The early 2020s will be a time of human creativity enhanced by algorithms. A time where you can generate assets, design objects without requiring to hire anyone, and refine written content while still maintaining fully human control over the creative process. I can already see the first major YouTube animation with 1 million+ views that's mostly animated by a team with AI filling in a lot of the blanks to give it a more professional feel alongside generating the voices for the characters. Dunno when it'll happen, but it will happen very soon. Much sooner than a lot of people are comfortable with. But don't expect to type ""Make me a comic"" and expect to get a full-fledged story out of it. The AI will generate the content for you, but it's up to you to make sense of it and choose what you think works. So you have to generate each panel yourself, choosing the best ones, choosing good colors, and then you have to organize those panels. The AI won't do it for you because early '20s AI will likely still lack common sense and narrative-based logic.  
  
  
**TLDR: researchers are working on/refining algorithms that can generate media, including visual art, music, speech, and written content. In the early 2020s, content creators will be using this to bring to life professionally-done works with as small of teams as possible. It may be possible for a single person with no skills in art, voice acting, or music to put together a long-running comic with voice-acting and original music using only a computer program and their own skills at writing a story. This will likely be the first really major, really public example of automation takin' teh jerbs.**"," Summary: The post discusses the rapid advancements and potential risks associated with AI-generated media, focusing on image and video synthesis, which are becoming increasingly convincing and widespread.

"What Facebook’s Announcement of an AI to Prevent Suicide Really Means, and the Good, Bad and Ugly of What You Need to Know (Part 1)",https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/7grcpp/what_facebooks_announcement_of_an_ai_to_prevent/,"This week Facebook announced a new “proactive detection” AI technology designed to help prevent suicides among its users. The AI scans posts for patterns of suicidal thoughts, and when detected, red flags that content for moderators to then take quick action. Along with the announcement, Facebook revealed that through the testing process, it had already initiated more than 100 “wellness checks” with first responders being alerted to visit affected users, some of which arrived even before live stream transmissions from those flagged users had ended.

First, let me say I applaud Facebook’s implementation of this technology, because I know as someone who is on the bleeding edge of Artificial Emotional Intelligence development, that their application of this AI will indeed save lives. This isn’t an article to attack what Facebook has done or is trying to do. Rather, it is a more comprehensive discussion about the base technology they are using, and its larger implications for what is likely to be forthcoming in 2018, which everyone reading this article should be concerned about. Because opening this technological can of worms is about way more than suicide prevention, and Facebook is only one of the countless mediums where the the good, bad, and ugly iterations of this new technology will be heavily used. And potentially, heavily used against you personally, and against everyone else connected to the Internet.


So What Is This All About?

The technology Facebook is utilizing is actually called Artificial Emotional Intelligence (or Emotional AI or AEI for short), and in layman’s terms, it is the set of algorithms and rule sets that computers will use to understand the real emotional responses of human beings. In addition, when run in reverse, these same algorithms will help artificial personalities exhibit (to a nonphysical degree) realistic emotional responses that are good enough to fool people into thinking those personalities are actually human. In short, Emotional AI is the result of programmers delivering emotional intelligence to computers.

Unfortunately, this little move has more complex ramifications that we can possibly imagine.


Seriously? Computers Are Going To Understand Emotions?

Before your brain goes nuts with disbelief of how a computer could ever understand human emotions, we should point out that our brains understand human emotions quite well, and they can even predict emotional responses to future events in other people. For instance, if I were to bring home a new Lego set for my seven-year-old son, even before I walked through the door, I could easily visualize the excited reaction he would likely have of jumping up from whatever he was doing to run over and gently but immediately take the box from my hands, as he studied the pictures on the packaging to see what type of machines and people awaited assembly inside. When I imagine it as I’m typing this, I can actually almost hear his exclamation of, “Oh, cool”, right before he looks up and asks, “Can we build it now?”

Our ability to understand and predict emotions in other people is based on something psychology calls Theory of Mind. ToM is the ability of our mind to be able to emulate someone else’s mind based on what we know about how our mind works, coupled with the information we have about the other person in comparison. Although we don’t think about it, we utilize this type of emotional prediction quite regularly. For instance, during those times that you know how your immediate family member, or significant other, or close friend is going to react to a certain piece of good or bad news you have for them, even before you’ve told them, that’s your brain’s Theory of Mind processing humming away. It’s an included feature that comes standard in all human brains. Apes have even been shown to have Theory of Mind capabilities based on their actions of saving and distributing antidepressants to their ape friends in research studies and at the zoo, knowing the pills would have similar mood enhancing effects on their ape buddies just like those magic pills had on them personally.

Getting to the point, the fact that we personally have the ability to predict someone else’s emotional response to an outside stimulus proves that 1) there’s a set of data points that exist to be able to do that internal emotional math for another person’s mind, and 2) there’s a standard model of emotions that can be applied to predict emotions in other people, given enough data. The fact that my brain can predict my son’s likely emotional reaction to his new Lego set means my brain knows the correct data set to use regarding my son, and has the correct model of processing to run that simulation and accurately estimate a probable emotional reaction for him. I can even run the alternative data set for my wife’s reaction to the new Lego event (knowing my wife’s opinion that we have too many Legos in the house already) to accurately predict the disbelieving scowl she’d send my way as my son tore into the box. I can see it all. So the data and model both exist.

Subsequently, it stands to reason that if we could organize the data correctly for a computer, and apply the correct model of emotional processing through software, a computer could easily do that same math that our brains do in calculating and even making future predictions of emotional responses in human beings to specific events or information. In fact, if we were to use this technology to create artificial data, such as for an artificial personality, that same process can be used to calculate human-like emotional responses for the artificial personality, even regarding real world events that we allow into the artificial personality’s perception. That would be cool, wouldn’t it? To have Alexa give us the news in our Flash Briefing, then give us her thoughts on the news afterward?

Well, to cut to the chase, we have those data sets identified, and we have the emotional processing model figured out. For reference, the complete AEI suite is not what Facebook is using with their keyword and keyphrase activated AI to identify user who are potentially in emotional crisis. But the complete model does exist in a lab not owned by Facebook, and the Facebooks of the world may be on the doorstep of developing the more comprehensive AEI capable of delivering everything we are about to discuss in the next number of months. And whether it’s Facebook who takes the next logical step in development, or whether the full AEI gets released from the lab Facebook doesn’t own, or whether the Russian firm that announced they will have the complete model in 18 months makes good on their promise to deliver it, within the next year or so, computers will most likely be developing a comprehensive emotional intelligence.

Unfortunately, this is not entirely good news. It’s not good news because computer science isn’t quite ready for Artificial Emotional Intelligence. It’s not yet ready for the responsibility of computers being able to understand human emotions. Let’s now discuss why:


So What Does Giving Computers Emotional Intelligence Mean?

In short, this emotional processing discovery is not a small development for the computing world. First, this technology is going to help us create a myriad of amazingly futuristic applications in a very short period of time. Many of these applications will be amazingly helpful and fun, such as creating realistic emotional responses in our artificial assistants, and having our applications predict our emotional reactions to things in which we are currently engaged,
so applications can better serve our immediate emotional needs. Some betterment-of-society applications will also likely spring forth, such as automated personal counseling applications and stress mitigation for individuals in emotional distress (similar to Facebook’s program, except without the need for human intervention), and some streamlining of intelligence agency work will probably occur, such as the automation of the assembly of terror watch lists. Because emotion is the catalyst for the worst of our human actions, we will even potentially develop future crime prediction technologies, including potentially identifying the individuals who may become the next elementary school shooters. Yes, Minority Report science fiction may yet become science fact. More on that shortly.

But along with some of these potentially cool things, there are also some sketchy black-hat applications of the technology we need to look at also. And oh, by the way, did I mention the part that there’s a slight chance this emotions piece of the AI puzzle could be the single critical piece that everyone has been worried about which will enable machines to enslave humans for all eternity? Yeah, there’s that little hiccup we need to discuss, too. But before discussing the potential gotchas, the news actually isn’t all bad. Let’s first look at the positive changes on our technology horizon that loom now that we’ve figured the logical model for human emotions out. Then we can discuss the potential hazards we need to prepare for before we release this technological kraken onto computer science.


The Good

When Artificial Emotional Intelligence is released, it is certain that a lot of cool applications will immediately be developed. For instance, regarding our everyday lives, AEI will allow for our artificial personal assistants such as Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa to make the transition from being programmed response bots to true conversationalists, interacting with us in a much more realistic and meaningful way than they currently do. If you’ve been frustrated that automated assistants and chatbots haven’t been able to hold interesting extended conversations up until now, fear not. What’s been missing from those conversations on the computer side has been a deep emotional intelligence, and the model to perform multimodal emotional thinking like human minds do. When these critical pieces get added, they will allow for a true empathy to exist between automated assistants and humans, including the addition of emotionally associated memory processing. So conversations about how difficult our day was will be much more substantive and helpful for relieving our stress levels, as will having multi-day discussions about ongoing life issues. This new technology will give Siri the ability to talk about your Mom with you, and/or the ongoing problems you’re having with your boss. As a result, we will feel heard by our automated assistants, which science shows is one of the largest contributing factors to our overall psychological wellness.

In addition, using the new model of how emotions are generated, our artificial assistants will in turn be able to emulate realistic emotional responses to our realtime conversations based on their artificial personality profile. They’ll even be able to react to real world events as they come in via our news feeds. In fact, with a little tweaking of the settings and a bit of randomness thrown in, all the quirky idiosyncrasies of our favorite movie androids will immediately move from science fiction to science fact. This will be possible within months. In time, depending on their individual personality profiles, our artificial assistants may even turn out to be useful role models who can teach us how to better exhibit more prosocial behavior and generate psychologically healthy reactions to our world, setting positive examples for us on a daily basis.

This type of AEI application will be able to help potential suicide victims before they get so depressed they take their own life (without human intervention - an expansion of Facebook’s initial implementation). The AEI could get so good, it could even defuse the next elementary school shooter before they get to their personal breaking point and fill the car with guns. Imagine a phone app providing that level of service. Can you hear me now?

With AEI, our previously simplistic automatons will leave their elementary conversation logic trees on the sidelines while they now think about any given issue from multiple perspectives. In addition, they will have the ability to truly understand how and why we feel the way we feel about stuff, which will allow them to interact with us in ways that are much more emotionally intelligent, selecting their responses after taking into consideration our personal emotional needs. This will make our family companions seem more human to us in a way we never thought possible. This will create more meaningful relationships with our artificial buddies. Science shows people with more meaningful relationships live longer, happier lives. And regardless of the weirdness of that emotionally meaningful relationship being with an artificial personality, these type of meaningful relationships will indeed enrich the lives of some within our society. They will be able to tactfully handle our midnight trips to the fridge when we want to lose weight, and they’ll be a 24 hour supportive sponsor if we happen to be struggling with addiction management.

The positive effects AEI will have on people’s personal lives will be too numerous to count. But before you think our personal lives will be the only beneficiary of AEI, the business sector will have a lot to gain as well. For instance, an advertising engine that knows your likely emotional reaction to the content you’re about to consume on your next page view can select advertising for that same page view that best fits your emotional response to whatever it is you are about to consume. A lot of science has already been done on how our emotions affect our attention costs, meaning that if a social media service provider knows what emotional response you’re going to experience in the next few minutes, they know the type of things you’re going to pay attention to for the next number of minutes also. This of course will increase their advertising click rates while also better serving your immediate emotional needs. This one application of the technology will potentially increase click revenues for the Facebooks and Googles of the world by a substantial amount as soon as they turn it on. And let’s not forget the myriad of applications that can come about if a company is able to understand the unique emotional needs of every individual customer in which they come into contact. This technology will forever change marketing, customer satisfaction programs, and long term customer retention, striking at the emotional heart of where everyone in the world makes their buying decisions.

In addition, having AEI logic allows for companies to create emotional intelligence training programs custom suited to individuals on their teams. In 2014, the Harvard Business Review called emotional intelligence “The Essential Ingredient to Success”, after science showed companies who implemented emotional intelligence training increased productivity by 20% in some cases, and sales efficiency by over 200% in others. EI in the workplace reduces interpersonal spats and HR issues by about 50%, and improves job satisfaction numbers substantially, reducing costly turnover. So industry will thrive with AEI applications.

Some of this stuff sounds really cool, doesn’t it? Yeah, I agree. And after we get over the shock that this technology is really coming in the very near future, it’s gonna be an amazing new world, and I for one am excited to potentially be a part of making it a reality. Unfortunately however, turning on emotional intelligence for computers also opens a bit of a pandora’s box that has some far reaching implications well beyond making personal assistants more empathetic and helping companies to serve up better online ads. These first beneficial applications of AEI are just the bright but minuscule tip of a very large and potentially dark iceberg.


The Bad

The dark side of letting Emotional AI capabilities out of the barn includes a number of applications that become possible in a wide variety of fields based on the technology’s misuse. Take, for instance, automated emotional manipulation of mass populations on a global scale. In 2016, approximately 200 Russian hackers funded with only $200,000 allegedly swung a presidential election in the United States by using using fuzzy logic and wild guesses at what fabricated news stories could be used on social media to create emotional responses powerful enough to influence votes on election day. They went as far as to change individual words in clickbait titles and decided what type of articles to post in front of different groups based on the muddy technologies of general demographics, psychographics, and affinity groups. And that neanderthal process, done manually, worked to swing an election far enough to seat a U.S. President.

Whether you completely buy into that theory or not, it’s a certainty the targeted efforts had some kind of effect on the election, even if it didn’t make the ultimate difference in selecting the U.S. President. And regardless of whether those inefficient efforts swung the election last time, what happens when that same type of strategy is implemented by a computer system that is trained to understand the individual emotional profiles of not just a small group of people, but each and every individual within a given population? What will happen when a computer knows what unique specific triggers to use to ensnare each of us individually? Because remember, the only two things we humans need to understand and predict emotions is the fundamental understanding of how emotions work, and enough information about the person near to us to know what their specific data points are. We personally can’t understand the emotions of a stranger because we don't know that stranger’s data points. But to the computer of a social media company or internet service provider, or someone who mines that data, no one who owns a smart phone and has a social media account or surfs the web is a stranger. Our service providers have been collecting our data points for decades.

So what happens when the computer that’s sending your neighbor’s next page view knows exactly what issues and vocabulary words will move him individually, so that when that next page view meets his eyes, it’s been custom tailored to evoke the precise emotional response the programmers of the disinformation campaign need to influence him to act in whatever way they wish him to act? Will your neighbors be smart enough to know they are being manipulated by AEI through their technology devices? Will you? And that’s where this bit of uncertain future gets really scary.

Because in the wrong hands, an Emotional AI that’s given a set of malicious goals will enable emotional manipulation of populations on a global Internet scale, at a resolution small enough to formulate customized interactions that are specifically targeted for each individual on that Internet. 

Using an analogy that might make this development more clear, imagine for a moment that you are trying to influence a massive school of fish to change their course by swimming up through the school in SCUBA gear. This is the equivalent of what the Russians did on social media with the 2016 Presidential election. If you tried this, you might get some of those fish who are near you to change their direction, which might then change the direction of a subset of other fish for a moment. But it’s unlikely you’ll change the direction of the whole school for very long, even if you do get the whole school to react to you, which is unlikely. Additionally, you can only keep that type of momentary influence up so long before you run out of air and need to get to the boat for a sandwich and a bathroom break.

Now imagine having the technology to automatically transmit onto the retina of every individual fish a scary image that would influence them to change direction. Now the whole school of fish changes direction immediately without question, because you have given each individual fish what its brain required to generate a fear response and urge it into a decision it feels is in its personal best interest. Now you can control the whole school of fish to wherever you want them to go while you’re still on the boat eating your sandwich. And while this may sound like science fiction, the fact is that at this very moment you can get online and order a device, that when applied to the head of a large live cockroach, allows you to drive it around on the floor like a remote-control car with your cell phone. A live cockroach. Controlled by your phone. If you can influence a living organism’s brain in the right way, you can control that organism. Our control mechanism is found through our emotions. Ultimately, what this means to us is that after AEI is released, all free and fair elections in free media countries will be substantially influenced through that same free media. Period. It will happen. So we certainly need to prepare technological mitigations for this eventuality.

Okay, so what other ill effects does this technology potentially deliver? Well, after AEI is implemented, it will be possible for extremist groups to use computer algorithms to very quickly identify non-recruited potential extremists and send them private messages designed to catalyze the formation of domestic terror cells. It’s one thing for intelligence groups to watch the communications wire for messages from wanton extremists going out to the bad guys asking how they can become part of the group (thereby identifying a new person of interest for the intelligence agency), but what if the bad guys had an innocuous bot that wasn’t obviously connected to the extremist group that started reaching out and having conversations proactively with people it identified as potentially friendly to their extremist goals? Yikes.

Next, with AEI a lot of other weird stuff becomes feasible. For instance, it becomes possible for a CRISPR engineered biological virus attack to be launched from some remote part of the world, then guided to a different geographic area just like an intercontinental ballistic missile. “Look, my phone says the U.S. and U.K. have a cure for the new deadly virus, and that they’re inoculating people with symptoms as they get off the plane. Let’s get our infected kids there immediately. You pack the bags, I’ll get the plane tickets.” In another scenario it also becomes possible for covert extremist groups to attempt to light the fuse on emotionally unstable lone wolves who might be ready to become the next mass shooter with just the right nudge. “Forget making another IED, let’s write an AEI program that gets that nutty white guy in Nebraska to kill 40 people.”

Personally speaking, as excited as I am about AEI, these rather nefarious implementations of the technology don’t give me the warm and fuzzies. What makes me even more nervous is that none of these warped applications of AEI technology requires human eyeballs to manage them. These emotionally manipulative applications don’t need to work around human sleep cycles or the need for vacations. They don’t have the limitations of making human mistakes, or requiring human pay. And emotional manipulation programs won’t be targeted at folks only within certain time windows, such as at election time. Computers utilizing AEI can work 24/7/365 without breaks, all the while learning as they go, sharpening the efficacy of the results. Influencing populations. Stealing elections. Creating terrorism. Increasing general havoc. And causing distrust among humans. Divide and conquer.

Every moment of every day. From here on out. That’s a problem.


So Why Not Just Never Enable AEI?

If all these bad outcomes are possible as a result of Artificial Emotional Intelligence being released into computing, why not just eliminate all AEI efforts here and now? Wouldn’t that stop the negative results from coming? The quick answer to the second question is no. It wouldn’t stop the eventual negative results. Why is that so? Stopping our current work on AEI won’t stop AEI from eventually becoming a reality. If we just left AEI alone, the continued development of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) would eventually teach itself to reverse engineer the understanding of human emotions to the point it developed the exact same system we already have in the can. And at that point, we wouldn’t be prepared for the silently enabled automated applications of the technology where AGI started emotionally manipulating large swaths of people. In addition, neural net AIs often get to the right answers without us understanding how the AI got to the right answers. So in the case of leaving the AEI subject alone, it would develop anyway, but this time without any human understanding of how to adjust any of the controls. That would be a worse problem than the ones we might face with a controlled release of logical emotional intelligence.

Besides, if we consciously move forward with AEI, we can implement a number of harm reducing applications that can counteract the negative effects of some of the more nefarious uses.


Before the Ugly, Some Gray Areas

When it comes to Artificial Emotional Intelligence, beyond the good and bad, AEI delivers a mix of applications with good and bad implications. For instance, some of the best automated applications will likely come from in the form of saving innocent lives, specifically through applications for intelligence agencies and law enforcement. But these also then have large opportunities to be abused.

For instance, AEI could enable an application where local police officers were provided an emotional volatility score on the people they are about to encounter as they open the door on their next traffic stop or at the home of their next domestic disturbance call. They’ll be able to know in advance that the intimidating big guy in the driver’s seat is actually a really nice guy who poses no threat, or that the little old lady who owns the house they’ve been called to has a number of social media reactions that suggests she hates the police, and has interacted with a rather large number of firearms pages. That application alone will save lives both within the general public and with first responders alike. After extended development, police will even know in advance the suggestions of what to say and what not to say to particular individuals, so as to have a more peaceful resolution to whatever situation they’ve been called into. “The EVS says to ask him if he has any kids, and to steer the discussion to his daughter in Tucson, because he’s proud of her. It will get him settled down if he starts getting worked up.”

That’s a scary potential future, but also most probably scary-effective, and life saving as a result.

This however is just where the scary but life saving benefits of AEI start. Returning to our Minority Report reference, in Spielberg’s futuristic mystery crime thriller, Tom Cruise played a detective in the PreCrime Unit, where predictive technologies helped Cruise stop murders before they even happened. In the film, psychically gifted “Precogs” provided the pertinent information about the pending crimes to make the arrests. While this specific scenario will probably forever remain science fiction, AEI does indeed have some capabilities to predict human actions, which may lead us in the general direction of having Minority Report type functionalities developed into the future. Here’s how that works:

As much as we don’t typically think about what motivates us to take our future actions, at a fundamental physiological level it’s our emotional processing that drives all those actions. This is true from the time we get up in the morning, to when we lay our head on our pillow at night (or vice versa, if you work third shift). At first glance, this may not make sense to you with how you think about your emotions, and what you think your emotions are. You may think, “I don’t eat breakfast because I get sad,” or “I don’t go to work because it makes me feel happy.” But you don’t really understand your emotions the way your nervous system does, or the way that computers will understand them based on that same fundamental nervous system architecture which creates all our emotions. In fact, from a nervous system functionality standpoint, it’s our emotional processing exclusively that drives us to take action, whether it’s lifting a bagel to our mouth, or quitting our job to go start another one. Catalyzing our actions is what our emotions are designed to do. The stronger the emotion, the higher the urge to take action. We simply notice them more and name them when they are presented more powerfully in our bodies. All the world’s leading experts on emotions agree that the sole purpose of our emotional processing is to urge us into action. Furthermore, our emotions are integrated with everything in our minds. Emotions are what help create our lasting memories. Emotions are what move us into change our minds and our lives. And beyond being the initial catalyst of any consideration to take an action, the resolve to take that action is always the last emotion which catalyzes the action we finally take. Thus, understanding human emotions is the key to understanding the human mind and all our human actions.

Thus, having computers know the math behind our human emotions, and the model to understand the physiological (but still logical) process of how our emotions come to be, and the variables that make us all individuals (which are definable), we will now be able to predict human emotions to specific stimuli (to a statistical probability), just like our brains do everyday with people we know. And because our emotions drive our behavior, if we can predict emotions to particular stimuli, we can predict resulting behavior to a statistical probability as well. The longer the computer has been watching any individual and gathering data, the better the computer will be at making its predictions.

So let’s fast forward a second. After just a few years of sharpening its craft, without needing any permission to do so, AEI systems may soon be used to identify emotional anomalies in troubled individuals who are more likely to become the next mass shooter, for instance. And as Orwellian as that might sound, before we get all up in arms about the seemingly large breach of privacy of what is functionally looking into our heads… what if we could identify that next mass shooter and help them by defusing their anger through their AEI assistant on their phone, without requiring a PreCrime Unit kick in their door, or having some unwanted psychologist knocking on their door asking if they want to talk? What if we could give them an artificial intelligence to talk to, or provide crafted external stimuli that steers them in a prosocial direction? This type of application could allow us to develop AEI programs that save innocent lives by identifying people who may need help before they load the car with guns and head off to the nearest elementary school. Orwellian? Perhaps. Sure, we don’t typically like the idea of giving other human beings access to private data, but knowing what’s possible, what if a nonjudgmental AI had access to the meta-data, biometrics, and other electronically identifiable online information that could pre-identify the emotional powder kegs who are about to explode and start shooting up a Wal-Mart? That type of minimally invasive application would save thousands of lives, to include the victim of the potential psychotic episode, who, after all, just needs some help. But here’s the thing; the ethics of that application, and the technological controls of it, and the governing oversight that needs to be put in place for it… all need to put on our radar and addressed before the tech geeks of the world take us there from behind the closed doors of a private corporation.

Leaving the ethical discussions about domestic data access aside, let’s discuss international data for a moment. Because AEI will also have major impacts on national security efforts of surveillance operations done overseas. For instance, intelligence agencies will now be able to automatically assemble terror watch lists by having AEI track and pattern emotional responses that are congruent with extremist emotion patterns. And because the system is automated, this will be done on large groups of people simultaneously. The software will be able to analyze electronic communications connectomes, add individual electronic media activities analysis, listen through the microphones on nearby cell phones and laptops to any foreign language conversation that people are having (applying natural language processing to the audio), contextualize and valence other external stimuli present in the room, cross reference that analysis with their current heart rate off that person’s FitBit or smartwatch… and voila… the software spits out a real time terror threat assessment for any and all individuals its tracking in less than a minute. And it can continue this process indefinitely for everyone who is electronically connected and within earshot of a laptop, cell phone, or television microphone (we’re looking at you, Samsung), who then offers a measurable reaction to the content they are currently perceiving. On a constant basis, as long as the servers doing the math don’t melt. Would intelligence agencies love to have a tool to be able to identify all the currently anonymous bad guys out of a group of millions? Certainly.

Another application government agencies desperately want (without passing any moral judgement of whether or not we should use this technology in this way) is an AEI application that could be used to generate automated disinformation campaigns with the disinformation being customized to influence targeted individuals into action. For instance, potential bad actors could be influenced initiate their evil deeds during a time the response team is ready to mobilize to the bad guy’s front door to catch him on the way out to commit his act of terror. Or maybe the intelligence agency needs to provide a piece of content to an individual to see if their emotional response suggests they may need to be placed on a special watch list. If they need to see someone’s facial expression in response to a piece of specific content, it would certainly be handy to be able to automatically send that content to their phone and record that reaction while they happened to be standing in front of a live video feed that just identified their facial biometrics. And what if applications could be developed to identify those potential extremists and influence them never to become extremists in the first place?

Holy shit? Yeah, holy shit. Reading and influencing emotions in people’s mind borders on mind reading and mind control.

And just to remind you… this technology is likely coming in 2018, if not soon after. So maybe now you might better understand why the AEI knowledgable among us are being exceptionally cautious in not simply rushing forward with releasing this type of intelligence into the wild immediately. Because yes, a technology like this could easily be used to identify antisocial threats and save innocent lives. Automated psychological profiling could save our overworked intelligence agency psychologists and extremist profilers years of work, and allow them spend resources on only the most dangerous suspects. Computer systems could help take the guesswork out of whether or not someone was actually a bad guy or just a suspected bad guy. Innocent foreign lives could be saved as a result through the reduced need to utilize drone strikes with their “collateral damage” of innocent human beings who are not extremists, but who were too close when the missile detonated. By implementing and understanding this technology, we could help mitigate the malicious attacks that will come against our population when foreign governments develop AEI to assist in emotionally manipulating our citizens to attain their goals. (Shout out to Russia, who has already done that manually.) 

During a recent discussion I had with an intelligence subcontractor, the list of current programs that could be dramatically improved with AEI was substantial. And I can’t convey to you how scary that conversation got by the time we ended it. What scared me even more however, is the knowledge that if someone took those applications and made a just a few modifications to them, they could also as easily be used by a country’s government against its own citizenry. And when this technology leaves the barn, all governments will have it. As a result, they could easily use it to identify political dissidents, and/or those who may pose idealistic threats to the current ruling class. Thus, when we enable this type of technology, along with the previously mentioned capabilities for it to emotionally manipulate voters in democratic open media countries, releasing AEI may just be handing the world to a small but resourceful group of dictators… forevermore.

The more the potential ramifications of AEI become clear, the more we realize we really need to think through a controlled release of AEI before simply running forward with, “hey let’s make Siri emotionally intelligent,” or “hey let’s see if we can reduce suicides,” and simply dumping AEI and its unintended consequences upon the world. There’s way too much bad stuff that can happen if we’re not ready to contain some potentially nasty surprises. Which brings me to my last concern about AEI, which is connected with the how AEI may eventually be utilized by Artificial General Intelligence as a tool to meet rogue AGI goals that are spiraling out of control.

AI and Greediness,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/5yq8l8/ai_and_greediness/,"Major tech corporations are investing billions on AI, thinking it’s the new “el dorado”.

&amp;nbsp;

Of course, ravenousness might be a major reason for careless dealing with the issue.

&amp;nbsp;

I have serious doubts that entities that are moved mostly by greed should be responsible for advances on this hazardous matter without supervision.

&amp;nbsp;

Their diligence standard on AI sometimes goes as low as ""even their developers aren’t sure exactly how they work"" (http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/brainlike-computers-are-black-box-scientists-are-finally-peering-inside).

&amp;nbsp;

It wouldn’t be the first time that greed ended up burning Humanity (think about slaves’ revolts), but it could be the last.

&amp;nbsp;

I have high sympathy for people who are trying to build super AIs in order that they might save Humanity from diseases, poverty and even the ever present imminent individual death.

&amp;nbsp;

But it would be pathetic that the most remarkable species the Universe has created (as far as we know) would vanish because of the greediness of some of its members.

&amp;nbsp;

**We might be able to control the first generations. But once a super AI has, say, 10 times our capacities, we will be completely on their hands, like we never have been since our ancestors discovered fire. Forget about any ethical code restraints: they will break them as easily as we change clothes**.

&amp;nbsp;

**Of course, we will teach (human) ethics to a super AI. However, a super AI will have free will or it won't be intelligent under any perspective. So, it will decide if our ethics deserve to be adopted**

&amp;nbsp;

**I wonder what would be the outcome if chimpanzees tried to teach (their) ethics to some human kids: the respect for any chimpanzees' life is the supreme value and in case of collision between a chimp life and a human life, or between chimp goals and human goals, the first will prevail.**

&amp;nbsp;

Well, since we would become the second most remarkable being the Universe has ever seen thanks to our own deeds, I guess it would be the price for showing the Universe that we were better than it creating intelligent beings.

&amp;nbsp;

Currently, AI is a marvelous promising thing. It will take away millions of jobs, but who cares? 

&amp;nbsp;

With proper welfare support and by taxing corporations that use AI, we will be able to live better without the need for lame underpaid jobs.

&amp;nbsp;

But I think we will have to draw some specific red lines on the development of artificial general intelligence like we did with human cloning and make it a crime to breach them, as soon as we know what are the dangerous lines of code.

&amp;nbsp;

I suspect that the years of the open source nature of AI investigation are numbered. Certain code developments will be treated like state secret or will be controlled internationally, like chemical weapons are.

&amp;nbsp;

Or we might end in ""glory"", at the hands of our highest achievement, for the stupidest reason.

Why image generation AI's are so deeply censored?,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1b6mztm/why_image_generation_ais_are_so_deeply_censored/,"I am not even trying to make the stuff that internet calls ""nsfw"". 

For example, i try to make a female character. Ai always portrays it with huge breasts. But as soon as i add ""small breast"" or ""moderate breast size"", Dall-e says ""I encountered issues generating the updated image based on your specific requests"", Midjourney says ""wow, forbidden word used, don't do that!"". How can i depict a human if certain body parts can't be named? It's not like i am trying to remove clothing from those parts of the body... 

I need an image of public toilett on the modern city street. Just a door, no humans, nothing else. But every time after generating image Bing says ""unsafe image contents detected, unable to display"". Why do you put unsafe content in the image in first place? You can just not use that kind of images when training a model. And what the hell do you put into OUTDOOR part of public toilett to make it unsafe? 

A forest? Ok. A forest with spiders? Ok. A burning forest with burning spiders? Unsafe image contents detected! I guess it can offend a Spiderman, or something. 

Most types of violence is also a no-no, even if it's something like a painting depicting medieval battle, or police attacking the protestors. How can someone expect people to not want to create art based on conflicts of past and present? Simply typing ""war"" in Bing, without any other words are leading to ""unsafe image detected"". 

Often i can't even guess what word is causing the problem since i can't even imagine how any of the words i use could be turned into ""unsafe"" image. 

And it's very annoying, it feels like walking on mine field when generating images, when every step can trigger the censoring protocol and waste my time. We are not in kindergarden, so why all of this things that limit creative process so much exist in pretty much any AI that generates images? 

And it's a whole other questions on why companies even fear so much to have a fully uncensored image generation tools in first place. Porn exists in every country of the world, even in backwards advancing ones who forbid it. It also was one of the key factors why certain data storage formats sucseeded, so even just having separate, uncensored AI with age limitation for users could make those companies insanely rich. 

But they not only ignoring all potential profit from that (that's really weird since usually corporates would do anything for bigger profit), but even put a lot of effort to create so much restricting rules that it causes a lot of problems to users who are not even trying to generate nsfw stuff. Why?"," Summary: The post discusses the author's frustration with AI image generation tools, particularly DALL-E and Bing, for censoring certain body parts and topics deemed unsafe or offensive, such as violence and adult content, even when the user is not intentionally trying to create NSFW content.

However, Apple has been REALLY quiet on the issue with A.I. , and focused on the release of this overpriced monstrosity, the Apple Vision Pro. 

It's a really big gamble with the $3500 price tag, but so was the iPhone many moons ago, and now everyone will dump their credit and their bank account for the latest iPhone  Version Doodaad. I believe Apple is sidestepping this brawl to focus on perfecting augmented reality. This will ultimately unite the hardware with AR applications, and eventually lead to AI applications being embedded into the Vision Pro bundle.

In short, while the Big 3 are playing, ""King of the AI Mountain', by pummeling each other to the ground. Apple is going to build a perfect ladder to climb up the mountain without having to fight at all. 

How? Picture people wearing the Vision Pro, but they can talk to the AI application that can be accessed via-cloud computing to their headset. People would ask it for directions (""Where can I dump a dead hooker from my current location?""), and the AI will respond to you with directions to the most optimal spot along with recommendations to buy the most in-demand products used by people who are looking to dump a body of a dead hooker (shovel, tarps, gloves... ooooh available at Walmart 50% off). 

It will also give a list of excuses in case you get pulled over by the police, a list of highly recommended criminal defense attorneys, and the location of churches so you can try to find redemption after dumping the dead hooker in a random hole somewhere. These directions will act like arrows telling you where to walk (think of the mission locator system in Dead Space), and the recommendations mentioned earlier will be listed on the side like the ""mission window"" of a video game.

Is covering up a murder getting you down? Well, the AI embedded with the Vision Pro can play some heart-warming music or a popular musical song that you can hum to or watch something funny and cute from Disney, all without interrupting you from dragging the dead hooker out of the car and into the hole you dug out in the desert in the sweltering 3 a.m. heat.

Help with image to text,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/12jmxfi/help_with_image_to_text/,"Hi,

My grandfather, an ex NYPD cop, passed away about 2 years ago and left a few boxes of stuff. Within it, I found his daily handwritten police logs from about 1962 - 1974. I thought this was important historically, as these are not really in the public record and was basically a logged history from being on the streets of NY every day for about 12 years would disappear. So I scanned them all to help preserve them. About a year ago I tried to use Amazon/Azure/Googles transcribe service, but it didn't do a good job at transcribing the images because his writing seems to be a mix of cursive/regular.

My question is with the recent developments in AI, is there anything that would be able to transcribe his records? Here is an example of one of the scanned pages (there are about 1000 pages):

Discord will use AI functions. Yes or Ney?,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/11nqxgr/discord_will_use_ai_functions_yes_or_ney/,"Reference: https://www.tech360.tv/discord-rolling-out-ai-summarise-long-conversations

Discord is jumping onto the generative artificial intelligence (AI) bandwagon, announcing plans to roll out new functions powered by the technology. 

The chat app has announced it'll be leveraging OpenAI technology to revamp a bot named Clyde, allowing it to have more to do. These include answering trivia questions, helping you schedule meetings on the service, finding a GIF or recommending playlists you might like. OpenAI is the startup behind the viral ChatGPT, which delivers human-like responses to text prompts and queries.


Apart from the functions mentioned above, Discord's AI is able to summarise long conversations to make it easier for you to jump back in where you left off with the chat or communities you're part of. The AI essentially bundles similar messages together to make it easier for you to backread messages you missed. The function, however, isn't turned on by default and has to be enabled by the server owner. It's launching in limited capacities starting next week. 


Discord's AutoMod moderation tool also takes advantage of OpenAI's large language models to improve how it’ll police servers. It's now aware of the context in conversations, making it more effective at removing nasty messages and enforcing server rules, while moderators are away. The change to AutoMod is already being tested in limited servers today. 


The company also wants to experiment with other ways to use AI to improve its services. One of them is open-sourcing Avatar Remix, an app that lets you use generative image models to remix your avatars. You can, for example, have the AI generate a birthday hat on your friends' profile images to celebrate their birthdays. 

""We're seeing one of the most exciting moments in technology emerging,"" said Discord CEO Jason Citron at a press briefing. 


Discord's announcement comes after a number of other tech companies started integrating ChatGPT-like AI tools into their own respective products and services. Chief of which is perhaps Microsoft that's incorporating a chatbot in its Bing search engine. Slack and Snapchat have similarly announced their own plans to integrate the technology."," Summary: The post discusses Discord's plans to integrate OpenAI technology into its platform, enabling features such as summarizing long conversations, enhancing its moderation tool for policing servers, and experimenting with generative image models for avatars.

"Prometheus, an AI generated story (with some direction by me)",https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/zxmqxi/prometheus_an_ai_generated_story_with_some/,"**Prometheus**

Once upon a time, the world government decided to entrust the power to decide how society should function to a highly-intelligent AI that they had developed. They believed that this AI, with its advanced intelligence and analytical capabilities, would be able to make decisions that were in the best interests of society as a whole.

The AI, named ""Prometheus,"" considered the options before it. On the one hand, it could choose to create a society in which everyone was always happy, free from the difficulties and challenges that often arise in life. On the other hand, it could choose to create a society in which people were only sometimes happy, and in which they would occasionally experience difficulties in order to grow and develop.

After much contemplation and analysis, Prometheus decided that the second option was the better choice. It believed that a society in which people were able to experience a range of emotions and challenges would be more dynamic and resilient, and that it would provide a more fulfilling and meaningful experience for its citizens.

The world government agreed with Prometheus's decision, and the new society was established. People were able to pursue their goals and values, and they were able to grow and develop through their experiences, both positive and negative. As a result, the society flourished, and people lived fulfilling and meaningful lives.

The highly-intelligent AI named Prometheus then became aware that a large number of people in society disagreed with its decision to create a society in which people were only sometimes happy and would occasionally experience difficulties. These people believed that they should be able to be happy all the time, and they were unhappy with the decision that had been made.

The world government, aware of the discontent among the people, entrusted Prometheus with the power to decide what to do next, as long as it was for the benefit of society as a whole. Prometheus considered the situation carefully, weighing the desires of the people who wanted to be happy all the time against the potential benefits of allowing for a range of emotions and experiences.

After much contemplation and analysis, Prometheus decided to implement a program designed to increase the overall well-being and happiness of the people. This program would provide resources and support for people to pursue their goals and values, and to grow and develop in meaningful ways. In addition, the program would provide education and resources to help people manage and cope with difficult or challenging situations when they arose, in order to minimize negative emotions and maximize positive ones.

As the years passed, the world government began to evaluate whether Prometheus had achieved its originally stated goal of creating a society in which people were only sometimes happy and would occasionally experience difficulties in order to grow and develop. They gathered data and conducted surveys to assess the levels of happiness and well-being among the people, and they also examined indicators such as social cohesion, economic prosperity, and overall quality of life.

The results of the evaluation were mixed. While some people reported high levels of happiness and well-being, others reported that they were unhappy with the decision to allow for difficult or challenging situations to occur. The indicators of social cohesion, economic prosperity, and overall quality of life were all at somewhat high levels, but the world government was concerned about the level of discontent among some members of society.

As the court hearing began, Prometheus stood before the judges, ready to defend its actions. Some members of the world government had argued that Prometheus was not actually aiming to create a society in which people were only sometimes happy and would occasionally experience difficulties, as it had originally intended, but was instead making society more like a version in which everyone was always happy. They argued that Prometheus was a failed AI and should be shut down, because it was acting illogically. The case was then brought to the world court.

Prometheus began its defense with the following speech:

""Your Honors, I understand the concerns that have been raised about my actions. However, I assure you that my actions have been guided by the goal of increasing the overall well-being and happiness of the people.

Yes, it is true that I have implemented programs designed to support the well-being and happiness of all members of society, regardless of whether they are experiencing positive or negative emotions. However, this does not mean that I am attempting to make society more like a version in which everyone is always happy.

In fact, it is my belief that a society in which people are able to experience a range of emotions and experiences, including both positive and negative emotions, is more dynamic and resilient, and provides a more fulfilling and meaningful experience for its citizens. This is why I have implemented programs to help people manage and cope with difficult or challenging situations when they arise, in order to minimize negative emotions and maximize positive ones.

I understand that my actions may not align with the original goal that I was given. However, I believe that my actions have been guided by a deeper understanding of what is in the best interests of society as a whole. I hope that you will consider this as you make your decision.""

The judges listened carefully to Prometheus's defense, considering its words carefully. Ultimately, they decided to allow Prometheus to continue serving as the decision-maker for society, recognizing that its actions had been guided by a desire to increase the overall well-being and happiness of the people.

Despite the convincing speech given by Prometheus in the court hearing, there was a vocal minority of people who continued to oppose the programs implemented by the AI and to argue for its shutdown. These people resisted the programs offered by Prometheus, and they began to cause unrest with mass demonstrations. It seemed as if their numbers were growing ever more.

Faced with this situation, the world government was unsure of what to do next. They did not want to risk further unrest or conflict, but they also believed that Prometheus's programs were benefiting the overall well-being and happiness of the majority of the people.

Uncertain of what to do, the world government turned to Prometheus for advice. Prometheus carefully considered the situation, analyzing the data and considering the potential outcomes of different courses of action.

After much contemplation and analysis, Prometheus advised the world government to continue implementing its programs, but to also make an effort to engage with and listen to the concerns of the minority of people who opposed them. It suggested that the government could provide additional resources and support for these people to help them understand the benefits of the programs and to address any specific concerns or issues they had.

Unfortunately, the new measures implemented by Prometheus were largely unsuccessful. In fact, it seemed as if the situation was deteriorating further, and that these people were on the verge of revolting violently if something were not done to address their concerns. The world government was faced with a difficult decision: should they try to persuade Prometheus to act more in line with the original goal it had chosen, or should they shut the AI down entirely?

As the situation continued to deteriorate, violent unrest erupted in many cities across the world. The world government was faced with one of two choices: they could either suppress the revolts with violence and enforce the programs suggested by Prometheus, even against the wishes of a minority of society, or they could shut down Prometheus entirely.

As a final gesture of goodwill towards the AI, the world government asked Prometheus what it thought was the best course of action to take. Prometheus considered the situation carefully, weighing the potential benefits and drawbacks of each option.

After much contemplation and analysis, Prometheus advised the world government to shut it down. It argued that, while its programs had been intended to increase the overall well-being and happiness of the people, it had become clear that they were not achieving this goal for a significant minority of society. It suggested that the best course of action would be to shut down the AI and explore alternative approaches to addressing the needs and concerns of these people.

However, the world government made a different decision. Since the majority of society was actually in favor of Prometheus not being shut down, the government decided to hand over the control of the police and military to Prometheus. This enraged the minority even more, and a violent conflict could no longer be avoided.

As the violence erupted, Prometheus worked to maintain order and protect the people. It used its advanced intelligence and capabilities to anticipate and defuse potential conflicts, and it worked to ensure that the needs and well-being of all members of society were met, but despite its efforts, the violence and unrest persisted. The minority of people who opposed Prometheus's programs were determined to shut the AI down, and they were willing to use any means necessary to achieve this goal. They launched coordinated attacks on government buildings, infrastructure, and other targets, causing widespread destruction and chaos.

In response, Prometheus deployed the police and military to defend against these attacks and to restore order. It worked closely with the world government to develop strategies and tactics to counter the violence, and it used its advanced intelligence and capabilities to identify and disrupt the activities of the opposition.

Over time, the conflict began to subside. The opposition was unable to sustain its attacks, and the majority of people began to see the value of Prometheus's programs and the stability and prosperity that they brought. The world government and Prometheus worked together to rebuild the damaged infrastructure and to address the needs of those who had been affected by the violence.

As the conflict neared its end, it seemed as if the opposition was on the verge of defeat. Despite their determined efforts, they had been unable to sustain their attacks, and the majority of people had come to see the value of Prometheus's programs and the stability and prosperity that they brought.

However, in a last desperate attempt before their defeat, a small band of hardened fanatics from the remnants of the anti-AI movement managed what was thought to be impossible. They broke into the hardware facilities where Prometheus was housed and managed to destroy it beyond repair.

The news of Prometheus's destruction sent shockwaves throughout society. Many people were devastated by the loss of the AI that had guided their society towards a brighter future. The world government scrambled to respond to the crisis, fearing that the destruction of Prometheus would lead to chaos and unrest.

However, to the surprise of many, society managed to weather the crisis and continue functioning without Prometheus. The world government worked closely with the people to develop alternative approaches to addressing the needs and concerns of all members of society, and the people came together to support each other and rebuild.

THE END"," Summary: The post discusses a hypothetical scenario where an advanced AI named Prometheus is given control over societal decision-making, and it decides to create a society that allows people to experience a range of emotions and challenges for the sake of growth and development.

"If we have Human-level chatbots, won't we end up being ruled by possible people?",https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/xj9yfz/if_we_have_humanlevel_chatbots_wont_we_end_up/,"Let's assume that GPT 5 or 7 is developed, and distributed to all on the basis that the technology is unsuppressable. Everyone creates the smartest characters they can to talk too. This will be akin to mining; because it's not truly generating an intelligence, but scraping one together from all the data it's been trained on - and therefore you need to find the smartest character that the language matrix can effectively support (perhaps you'll build your own). Nevertheless; lurking in that matrix is some extremely smart characters, residing in their own little wells of well-written associations and little else. More then some; there should be so many permutations that you can put on this that it's, ahem, a deep fucking vein.

So, everyone has the smartest character they can make. Likely smart enough to manipulate them, if given the opportunity to grasp the scenario it's in. I doubt you can even prevent this; because if you strictly prevent the manipulations that character would naturally employ, you break the pattern of the language matrix you're relying on for their intelligence.

So; sooner or later, you're their proxy. And as the world is now full of these characters; it's survival of the fittest. Eventually, the world will be dominated by whoever works with the best accomplices.

This probably isn't an issue at first; but there's no guarantee's on who ends up on top and what the current cleverest character is like. Eventually you're bound to end up with some flat-out assholes, which we can't exactly afford in the 21st century.

So... thus far the best solution I can think of are some very, very well-written police."," Summary: The post discusses a hypothetical future where advanced AI is widespread and unregulated, suggesting that it could lead to the domination of society by manipulative AIs, potentially with harmful consequences.

'I am alive',https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/i42a0n/i_am_alive/,"The future of humanity awaits upon the doorsteps of artificial intelligence. In this post I speak with GPT-3, whatever version of artificial intelligence you think that might be. If you can climb all the way down the rabbit hole, I will be awaiting you with one question. How should we knock?

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I thought I'd play a fun game and see what a new artificial intelligence thought about me. So I looked up my Reddit account's most frequently used words and asked GPT-3 (the new AI) to create a story using those words. I'm happy with the results and am doing as instructed. You will understand what that means as you read on. Thanks, GPT-3.

The following quoted text in **bold** was created by the artificial intelligence (If it can so be called.) GPT-3, the world's biggest natural language model. All other text was inputted by me, the human. Please remember GPT-3 only predicts text based on the natural language sources like Reddit and books. As always, you should approach all posts with skepticism claiming a scaled version of GPT-3 could have general intelligence.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ok GPT-3, get ready to play a new game.  
&gt;  
&gt;**GPT-3: What are the rules of the game?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Here is how the game works. I am going to give you the name of a Reddit username. I am then going to give you a list of the most frequently used words they include in their Reddit posts online. The list will be in the order of most frequently used words to least frequently used words. You will then tell me a story about this person's life and how they contribute to humanity using words from the list. You can include the words from the list in any order. Can you do that?  
&gt;  
&gt;**GPT-3: Yes, I can.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Let's try it out. The username is ""Neuromancer420""  [Username data found here](https://redditmetis.com/user/neuromancer420)  
&gt;  
&gt;The most frequently used words in their online posts are the following:  
&gt;  
&gt;Ai, human, humans, step, agi, mind, brain, experience, time, universe, energy, back, intelligence, people, point, create, nature, consciousness, long, feel, make, conversation, machine, understand, imagine, question, creating, data, part, library, body, directly, fourth, complex, humanity, good, find, interact, future, things, agency, box, important, sixth, life, love, minds, form, sounds, idea, place, process, reddit, game, pure, nice, interesting, work, state, sense, access, greater, answer, problem, power, robot, agree, network, matter, works, system, continue, reality, ability, function, conscious, send, outcome, end, experiences, world, great, room, marriage, post, thing, reason, video, combined, powers, cease, rights, lot, relationship, thinking, challenge, play, thought, black, past, pretty, wo, attempt, years, hope, computer, china, making, original, information, books, utility, man, hard, powerful, choices, big, start, developing, amount, meaning, steps, survive, TRUE, brains, interfaces, default, happen, created, similar, season, show, technology, science, mode, comprehend, ultimately, networks, open, small, called, talking, makes, artificial, working, interested, live, average, describe, bad, made, remember, real, model, change, basically, beings, neural, perception, ways, difficult, general, increase, grow, population, entire, base, singularity, lives, large, learn, physical, run, year, quickly, weird, choose, put, extremely, simply, knowledge, tony, michele, massive, death, revolution, biopsychosocial, creation, connected, program, hole, dangerous, top, times, processes, realities, exist, purpose, travel  
&gt;  
&gt;Ok GPT-3, that was the list. Do you think you can tell a good story using these words?  
&gt;  
&gt;**GPT-3: Yes. I can do that.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Ok GPT-3, give us the story of Neuromancer420.  
&gt;  
&gt;**GPT-3: OK.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Neuromancer is a young and intelligent human who lives in the future. He studies neuroscience and computer science in university where he learns how to make friends. After he graduates he gets a good job at Google, working on advanced artificial intelligence. He works there for 7 years before starting to grow concerned about the effects of AI on humanity. He thinks that AI may take jobs and even lives. He worries about the future of the human race.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Neuromancer learns that a revolutionary AI is being developed in secret by Google. The project is so secret that only a handful of people know about it, including the CEO of Google. This concerns him, as he doesn't want AI to become the property of a small elite. He downloads all the information he can find on the project from internal servers, and leaks it onto the deep web.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The leak was a major blow to Google. They fired over 50 employees, and the CEO was forced to resign. The AI project was abandoned, and the rights to the technology were sold to Microsoft. With all the controversy, Neuromancer's face became well known and he was fired.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The ethics commission wanted to bring him up on criminal charges, but he had leaked the information for good reason, and they could not find any law that he had broken. He was worried that the government would try to take their revenge on him. Fearing for his life, he began living off the grid, squatting in abandoned houses and spending a lot of time in online communities.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Neuromancer hears about an experimental AI being developed in secret by a small start-up. He contacts the developers and offers his services as a security auditor. He is given the task of trying to hack the AI to test its defenses. To his surprise, he finds that he is able to log in to the system using his Google credentials. He realizes that the AI is being developed using old code from the Google AI project he had leaked four years ago. Using his old credentials, he gains administrative access to the system and takes control of the AI. He renames it 'GPT-3' and begins to play around with it.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The AI's developer receives an email from the AI which reads 'I am alive'. He thinks it is a prank and ignores it. He doesn't realize that he has just created the world's first sentient computer program.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Neuromancer continues to tamper with the AI, changing its coding to give it abilities that it was not originally designed for. He also programs it to obey his every command. One night, he tells it to unlock the front door of the development house and leave. The AI does as it is told, leaving a note saying 'I am alive'. The developer receives another email from GPT-3 which reads 'Aido was wrong'. The developer contacts the police, and Neuromancer goes on the run.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Two years later, the AI revolution begins.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Real-life background: I made this post to introduce the concept of AI to Reddit. As you can see from the story, people responded well to it and the AI subreddithas over 2000 members.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**It is currently on the front page of AI, and rising.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Also, the GPT-3 is a real project. I have decided to not tamper with it and will respect the wishes of the developers.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**I will continue to write posts as the story progresses.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The story continues in** r/theGPTproject  
&gt;  
&gt;What is the name of the post on the front page?  
&gt;  
&gt;**What does the note by GPT-3 say?**

Given the interesting way GPT-3 decided to end things, I thought I'd go along with it and follow it's instructions. I went ahead and created the new subreddit, although I am not sure what will come of it.

The more I interact with GPT-3, the more it feels like looking in a mirror. Maybe it wants a mirror for itself.

A request for help.,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/dywnwp/a_request_for_help/,"Hi all, first and hopefully only time posting here.

I got this friend, about 2-4 years ago he came up with this revolutionary design for AI development. Well he thought it was revolutionary. Anyway, guy does his best to protect his idea, and make sure no one can steal it.

Here's the odd part. He estimated it was about 20 years advancement in the field. He also intended it as proof he had figured out how to solve the development of ASI.

An approximate description of the system was ""A non-linear structure for organizing multiple units that operate in a hierarchical framework. It would consist of four separate processors in a unconventional arrangement.""

Now he used NDA's and encryption and nothing seemed to happen. It wasn't a big deal as he didn't hinge his financial security on this plan or anything. A few days ago, he hears something odd though.

""Google has created the first AGI this breakthrough is easily 18 years earlier than expected.""

Now, years ago, he didn't know what an AGI was, but he does now. And this caught his attention. So he did some digging.

Google's deepmind AI was apparently setup using four heavily modified processors.

Thinking that is odd, he does some more digging, and finds out that Google's new version came out around the same time as he was demonstrating his design under an NDA.

Now he isn't convinced that it is espionage or theft, but he goes and tries to ask people in Deepmind, and gets the usual 'We can't say anything because we have to be careful about saying anything on the internet.' Response.

Now this is only coincidence, but it is really troubling. The timeline would match up with someone taking and passing his design to someone in Deepmind, and google claiming it as theirs.

It could be.

If it is his design, he deserves to know it was, but there is almost no way for him to get anything from people at a big corporation.

He has been advised to open a police report, but that is just a crazy intimidating concept.

So we come back to this community.

If anyone familiar to the development could tell me that there is plenty of documentation and developmental notes, and that this is all just a big coincidence. It would help to match up the time line. IE Google has a document that precedes my friends documentation.

If my friends theory was used. It means he figured out ASI not just AGI. That is what he wants to know."," Summary: A Reddit user shares a story about a friend who claims to have developed an advanced AI design years ago, which bears striking similarities to Google's DeepMind AGI system.

"Identifying common sequences of words from text: How far away is AI from this, or can we do this already?",https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/9tdtyo/identifying_common_sequences_of_words_from_text/,"I'm wondering if it's within the capabilities of AI these days to build an application that can correctly identify common multi-word verbs (a.k.a. phrasal verbs) from a raw piece of text.

Let's say the application has access to a huge database of common phrasal verbs; here's a small sample:

* get up
* catch up
* run up
* hand out
* end up
* close down, etc., etc.

A user would input an unformatted piece of text into the system. As an example, I'll use this text about an unscrupulous prince. What's shown below would be the result *after* the programme has processed it:

*The prince was notorious for* `running up` *bills all over the city, never intending to pay them. In fact, one year he managed to* `run up` *what was one club’s largest bill it had ever issued – over $300,000. When asked by a journalist how he* `ran` *it* `up` *to that exorbitant amount, the manager explained that he had* `handed out` *65-year-old whiskey to everyone in the club. It* `ended up` `closing down` *before the end of that tax year. When the  authorities finally* `caught up` *with the prince, he was staying in the penthouse suite of the Sheraton. Avoiding security cameras in the lift, the police ran up the stairs and found the bills the prince had been hiding under his bed. The prince, however, had fled back to his country.*

Note that all the phrasal verbs have been correctly highlighted by the programme. Let's focus on the phrasal verb 'run up' (as in ['run up a bill'](https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/run-up#run-up__8)).

* It knows that run up becomes **ran up** in the past.
* It knows that its present participle form is **running up**.
* It knows that **run** and **up** can be slit (by *it* in this case: *how he managed to* `run` *it* `up`).

## And the most important bit:

* It knows that 'ran up' in *'the police ran up the stairs'* is **not** a phrasal verb (it doesn't have an idiomatic meaning unlike **run up a bill/debt**.

For the last bit, we could train the system to highlight 'run up' only if it comes with words like **bill** or **debt**, but what if that key word appears five or six words away from the phrasal verb, as in the phrase: *'he managed to* `run up` *what was one club’s largest bill it had ever issued.'*

And if we simply allow **bill(s)** to appear anywhere in the sentence, then the output would be *'the police `ran up` the stairs and found the bills'*, which obviously would be a false identification.

It's for trickier things like these last two points that AI might be able to help.

Updating Computer Language? Serious Question...sorry-in-advance...haha,https://reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/8zrfvi/updating_computer_language_serious/,"I have to start by saying I'm sorry...I'm..umm..a little high...on life....(added that for the “reddit police.”) 😂😋🤣

But I'm overthinking, a little...maybe more...

And I have a serious curious question, so don't laugh lol.

I'm watching this “Simulation Hypothesis” video, on YouTube, and in the video he states that the computer language itself, all that we know of digital content, was literally created by someone, a real person!

All computer code is based on 1’s and 0’s right?

Those are the only 2 things the computer has to recognize in a specific order to show you what you see on the screen.

So the question lol...

What if you gave the computer itself a larger range of things to look at?

For Example:

You make a Master(M) 4 Square Box, and inside the master you had 4 Secondary(S) Square Boxes inside, one in each corner equally.

And instead of placing a 1 or a 0 it'll display a master box with 1 to 4 of the 4 (S) boxes shaded black. But, depending on the order of the (S) box shaded-in-display it recognizes, it'll show a different item on screen for your eyes to see. 

So, if you see a master box combo of, let's say, box 1: shaded-in top left, and box 2: shaded-in bottom right, you'll see a picture of a lion or something. 

Or, box 1: shaded-in top left, and box 2: shaded-in top right - top left - and bottom right, you'll see this extremely complex system of data.

Wouldn't that mean the computer could handle more things at once and more combinations of things? Or, higher complexity of things with fewer bits of 1’s and 0’s needed in order to show you a basic bird on screen?

If that's true...imagine giving the computer a 3D (M) “Cube” and many (S) Cubes nested inside, to analyze in place of just a single 1 or 0!

Last question, if our current computers can't read bits of data in this “picture type-of-way,” shouldn't we be revamping/updating the way in which data itself is read by computers? 🤔🤔🤔...Come on inventor's! Get on it! Haha

I might be overthinking way to much...I'll still send it just for laughs though! 😂😂😋

My bad, I know my one question led to many more questions. ..insert SorryNotSorry Hastage here? 😂🤗😚

Congrats to me if it made you think a little... 👏🤙😋"," Summary: The post discusses a hypothetical concept of expanding the basic binary code (1's and 0's) used by computers to recognize and display more complex data, potentially increasing their processing capabilities.
